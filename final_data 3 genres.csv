Hip-Hop,"Jus' look at them I tell you, it warms the heart to see the little ones out there Why' know, it wasn' always this easy for us to sit back an' enjoy the little ones Never forget what your people wen' through to get you here An' it's for you to tell them about us. You know that, don't you? Yeah! Kick it! See'mon, my brothers/sisters out in every land! It's up to you to shake the world, so you must understand From where our people have come and to where they must go So now I'll kick a little history that you should know You see, the Jews have been oppressed for thousands of years To every corner of the world you can trace our tears We were enslaved by the Pharoahs 'till God sent Moses Even after he delivered us, it was no bed of roses For forty years we wandered on the barren desert sand 'Till Joshua the leader brought us to the promised land So when ya kick this rhyme, you want to sing it out loud You are the nation of our fathers. Young Jews, be proud! Now our people lived here, and they held this place And they were ruled by the great leaders of our faith Now, from the house of Jesse came David the King He kept the nation strong. He wrote the songs we sing His son Solomon the Wise had it down cold He asked God for wisdom when He offered him gold And there were other dark times for the Jewish race When the innocent were persecuted for our faith But we owe a debt to all those who have died To forever stand tall and face the world with pride So when ya kick this rhyme, you want to sing it out loud You are the nation of our fathers. Young Jews, be proud!"
Hip-Hop,"Union Jack and Union Jill Back up and down the same old hill Sell the flag to the youths But who swallows the bill Murdoch she wrote Him have his hand in the till Blairful of Thatcher Stuck on the 45 The suits have changed But the old ties survive New britannia cool Who are you trying to fool? Behind your fashion-tashion I see nothing at all Care for the commodity Cuts the nation into three Rich pickings for the first Bottom third you never see While middle england keeps swinging it's Loyalty No concern for the future Just with dead royalty So will the real, the real Great Britan Step forward This is the national identity parade Shoe gazer nation forever looking Backwards Time to reject the sixties charade Not enough schools Not enough homes Just phony care in his millennium dome More prime cuts than beef on the bone And there's too many questions you're Not answering tone Union Jack and Union Jill Back up and down the same old hill Sell the flag to the youths But who swallows the bill Murdoch she wrote Him have his hand in the till So will the real, the real Great Britan Step forward This is the national identity parade Shoe gazer nation forever looking Backwards Time to reject the sixties charade"
Hip-Hop,"I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor That's not my business I don't want to rule or conquer anyone I should like to help everyone, if possible Jew, Gentile, black man, white We all want to help one another Human beings are like that We want to live by each other's happiness Not by each other's misery We don't want to hate and despise one another In this world there is room for everyone And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way Greed has poisoned man's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, Has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want Our knowledge has made us cynical Our cleverness, hard and unkind We think too much and feel too little More than machinery we need humanity More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men Cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world Millions of despairing men, women, and little children - Victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people To those who can hear me, I say do not despair The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed The bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, And the power they took from the people will return to the people And so long as men die, liberty will never perish Soldiers! Don't give yourselves to brutes Men who despise you, enslave you Who regiment your lives, tell you what to do What to think and what to feel! Who drill you, diet you Treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men Machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don't hate! Only the unloved hate, the unloved and the unnatural Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the 17th chapter of St Luke it is written: ""The Kingdom of God is within man"" Not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power, the power to create machines The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful To make this life a wonderful adventure Then, in the name of democracy Let us use that power, let us all unite!"
Hip-Hop,"In the studio I read a magazine They had a column in there asking people If they had 3 wishes What would they wish for? So I figured I'd ask myself... So if I had 3 wishes This right here would be my first: I wish I could bomb drop from the top of the Superdome On my skateboard, head up, play ball! Ollie over curbs in the 3rd Ward And then shook through the? Holla at tough guy Dodo Let him bang my brand new album In these Range Roves Puff a couple L's with him Go home, change clothes I go bring Polo, with matching Bally Animals. And then it's on to? To holla at my nigga Soulja Slim From the CutThroat Committee Split up a Philly, fill it with sticky And talk about all the hoes we fucked In out city. Give my man a hug Then I gotta get going, St. Bernard I holla at my homey Ace Let him see my new whip, ride out To the IHOP in the east and get a Bowl of cheese grits... That's what I wish for See, the 3 people I was talking about They're not alive no more East is a part of New Orleans Destroyed by Hurricane Katrina Here's my 2nd wish: [Verse 2] I just wish my nigga Wayne Would get the respect that he deserves In this fuckin game, he's the illest With these words, I know I might've said That shit before, but I'm just making sure It's heard! And my nigga Maine would Have the same success that I have Cause I'm oh-so blessed, yes And for my nigga Dizzy, 10 million Platinum plates, cause you work hard Homeboy, you deserve that And then we'd have a spliff Won't crumble to pieces like them other Real cliques.

Then they all stay rich and Those kids have more kids And they all get rich, then those kids Have kids... alright, alright I know that was a big wish... But I have a lot of people That I wanna thank, I feel like they Deserve that... now it's time for the 3rd wish: [Verse 3] I just wish that my ex girl would've never Fucked with any of my homies Cause it took a toll on me Now I give a fuck about her baby cause I feel like everyone is a phoney I'll never love again, move another bitch in Let her live in my crib, give her keys To my whip, shit... she ruined that For all these hoes now it's YMOB You know what I do Young Money Over Bitches, I don't Give em tongue kisses, I just Hit em with that dick and have em Pose for naked pictures And show em to my niggas, and then I gotta flip em, let everybody get a piece And after that I send em Back to where they living, but with her I was different. Word on the street was She was wyling out pretending not to hear it Girl, you had a good nigga. Oh no, I wasn't Perfect, but I had a good spirit That's the last of my wishes... That's a surprise to a lot of y'all huh? More than cars and skateboards and weed I did graduate nigga!"

Hip-Hop,"There's not much you could do or say to phase me People think I'm a little bit crazy I get it from all angles in a while to save me To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things Sometimes I forget what other people just may think A lot of rappers finally wouldn't know how to take me If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me I maybe a little too fast paced and racy Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times Cause I say so many rhymes, it may seem like I'm goin too fast 'cause my mind is racing And I could give a fuck what category you place me Long as when I'm pushing up daisies and gone As long as you place me amongst one of them greats When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z For every single die hard fan who embraced me I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me In the neighborhood daily, they jumped and chased me It only made me what I am today, see Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me You ain't gonna make or break me Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving to say to me You had all this time to think about it Now don't pussy out and try to wimp out, face me Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day That we finally meet in the same place to see [Chorus: x2] No matter how many battles I been in and won No matter how many magazines on my nuts No matter how many M-C's I end up Ooh ooh, it's never enough My flow's untouchable now you gotta face it Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics You go say the wrong shit and get your face split The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it The spot my talk, it blaze a direct hit Graze it, your peace talk, save it You shit sounds dated, you're overrated I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you mutherfuckers If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse Soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention boy?

Hip-Hop,"*******[PLAY SONG ""PINK TOES"" AT THIS POINT]******* [VISUAL] This is the part where they kinda fall in love a little bit. But I feel like anything we put here wouldn't do justice to what really happens when a person you meet ends up in your life out of nowhere. But know that it's exactly how you expect it to be, but also more. It's a big inside joke that you can't mess up and only one other person in the world gets It's not a very pretty or perfect love, or even necessarily a romantic love. It doesn't look cool. It's more like two helpless things in the wild, and one says ""I'll protect you"", and both parties know it's a lie because there's no way either of them can protect the other from anything. That lie is the best way to describe this love. That feeling of not having to say ""I'm scared"", because you share the exact feelings without having words over or under complicate it, that's worth more than protection. It's a connection. The less alone. This is all we look for on earth The Boy and Naomi hang a lot. They spend the night and make breakfast sometimes. He buys stuff for her. She makes him stuff. They watch cartoons together. They're always saying things, giving opinions, feeling interesting. They both have a purpose. It's a great time. Time passes The Boy starts moving small amounts of weed out the mansion, but starts selling more to keep up, along with stuff that isn't weed. He started growing crop in the nursery. The electricity bill would be high, but he stopped living in the mansion. He started renting another place to stay and keep the business separate To be honest it was getting a little out of hand, as Naomi predicted. The Boy is not a good dealer. A lot of people think you have to be cold and calculated, which he was to an extent. But you also have to know people. How they act/react. But it was still kinda fun up to this point Then: INT. RENTAL HOME - DAY The Boy is washing dishes as Naomi stands next to him. They just had lunch  NAOMI: Howbout'sm China, IL? THE BOY: Can't NAOMI: Can't why? THE BOY: I got a run to do NAOMI: Oh Silence NAOMI (CONT'D): I thought you were having other guys do that now THE BOY: I am. Fam can't do this one NAOMI: If you're putting up the money you shouldn't be making the run THE BOY: I don't really trust anyone else to do it NAOMI: You don't really trust anyone THE BOY: I trust you NAOMI: You shouldn't The Boy stops. She got em THE BOY: You're right NAOMI: I don't want to be right. I wanna help you THE BOY (said dumb): ""I don't wanna be right"" She doesn't laugh. He hopes she's LOLing inside. Cellphone vibrates on the counter across from them. The Boy goes over and reads the text  THE BOY (CONT'D): I gotta go NAOMI: Alright THE BOY: You okay? NAOMI: I'm fine THE BOY: Is that a fake ""I'm fine"" NAOMI: No. It's what ""I'm fine"" always means Nothing real is ever ""fine"". Remember this  THE BOY: I'll be back He walks out. They don't see each other anymore EXT. I-10 - DAY The Boy is driving down the highway listening to ""Danny Glover"" by Young Thug EXT. MANSION - DAY The car parks in the driveway. There are three cars already there. When he pulls up, he's playing ""Made in America"" by JAY Z and Kanye. When it goes off, he continues singing his version while walking up  THE BOY: Sweet Cream Havarti/ Sweet Mozzarella/ Sweet Cheez-its. They're made in America/ Sweet Bowl of Cheez-its/ Ohhhhh-oohhhhh- Four dudes are standing waiting at the front door Something is wrong The Boy stops singing and stands there in front of the dudes. They look at him. Alone They all pull out 45s ****[PLAY SONG ""EARTH: THE OLDEST COMPUTER"" AT THIS POINT]**** INT. MANSION - DAY They all walk in  DUDE 1: Where the packs? THE BOY: In that closet DUDE 1: Sit over there [VISUAL] The Boy sits in the living room. Maybe he could run out the back? Where though? They're at the top of a mountain. If someone heard a shot in this neighborhood, they'd call the police immediately. Unfortunately, there isn't a police department in the Palisades. He'd be waiting for the Santa Monica department, which would take a minute The feeling The Boy had now was shockingly similar to the feeling he got at his own parties. People he didn't know or like casually walking through his home and him having to pretend everything is ""fine"", or that they don't have all the power Maybe he could text Fam  DUDE 1 (CONT'D): Give me your phone The Boy hands him his phone. Fuck Two dudes stand guard at the front and back exits. One dude packs the bricks from the closet in a trash bag. Dude 1 (seems to be the leader) is looking through The Boy's phone It didn't feel like the day The Boy was going to die. Not to say The Boy didn't feel like he was going to die, he was certain he was going to die today. But he didn't feel like today felt like a/the last day/night. Like a Wednesday that keeps feeling like a Friday. But the more he thought about it, if the last day felt like the last day, the world would be a different place. The order we have everyday would vanish if you were guaranteed a warning. People wouldn't live like they do. They wouldn't care what you thought. It'd be anarchy. Or a utopia. Depending on who you ask Dude 1 puts The Boy's phone in his pocket. The Boy doesn't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Dude 1 and Dude 2 start talking. It's obvious they're discussing The Boy's fate If I was the director, the one who made this moment, the one who saw this moment millennia before, the one who coded this world and allowed this to happen, I'd have Thundercat's ""We'll Die"" playing as The Boy looks around at his once castle ...try to do your best Oh! It's like Tony Montana. But resigned and, frankly, more realistic, cause it's boring. Everybody dies. Most of them are boring All the dudes walk out except Dude 2. He stays. Dude 1 still has his phone as he walks out. The Boy realizes this action is bad  DUDE 2: Toss me your wallet This is bad. The Boy tosses the wallet. Dude 2 looks through it  THE BOY: Can I drown? Dude 2 looks up  THE BOY (CONT'D): I just want to die how I want There's a pool out there. You're supposed to get this wave of euphoria when you drown. Supposed to be good Dude 2 stares  THE BOY (CONT'D): I could just float there. They'd find me Dude 2 starts to walks over... (Does it change anything when you're aware of your last thoughts?) Dude 2 sits next to him  DUDE 2: We've been watching you for a while. You're very sloppy He's a cop. This nigga's a cop  DUDE 2 (CONT'D): I'm just gonna stay here with you for a minute. My guys are picking up those guys up the street THE BOY: Oh Silence  THE BOY (CONT'D): I'm going to jail? DUDE 2: Yep The Boy looks to the pool in the backyard and sees his own body floating lifeless [VISUAL] Eyes wide, bubbles clinging to his face. Orange, yellow, and brown leaves float above him. His left shoe floating far ahead, probably from struggling at some point. Next to the pool, Naomi and Steve stand over him. Neither is crying or really seem too upset. They just look on as if the movie they were watching took an abrupt turn and they're mildly interested rather than satisfied It looks peaceful. Fitting. He'd like to go out like that ...what's that sound? Tires SCREECH outside. Dude 2 stands up. There's a small crash outside. Yelling  VOICE: FREEZE! GUNSHOTS The Boy and Dude 2 look at each other Dude 1 kicks open the door. He starts firing. Dude 2 falls. A mist of red puff spurts from his chest. He's screaming Dude 1 turns to The Boy and sho ...(breath).....(breath).............(breath).. Silence *****[PLAY SONG ""LIFE: THE BIGGEST TROLL"" AT THIS POINT]***** [VISUAL] THE END"

Hip-Hop,"the light feels warm, im attracted to its presence, its honesty is bliss its divine from the heavens so I need exposure cause when you speak my heart gets warmer its like the perfect sandstorm ripping through my flesh exfoliating the past and leaving nothing left but I still hear liars I don't feel fire and my body glows illuminated yet flat lined submerged under the light I guess im baptized, I feel lonely, will you come hold me, but our love is feeling honestly its so strong the wind it whispers in my ear and says its so wrong but if Jesus loves me then he wont touch me the light attracts peace to my heart and the pieces of my heart are broken into shards but when all put together all remains the truth as long as the fear of our existence remains glued the true serum of knowledge will have you hearing shit dreaming of nightmares until your living it don't say im concealing it I know someone's hearing this plight to unite every spike of a pyramid you look into the future see nothing its blank deserted I hope its all worth it these humans truly deserve it. for making us feel worthless im doing you all a service and giving your life purpose that shines from the glow of a light tower the final hour from the screams of a night owl, but he's who made you, but when you suffer then why hasn't he saved you. its different the effects from a lighthouse which points north but our paths seems to fly south you hear the ocean singing birds crying you feel weak nervous emotions dying to have the heart of a lion but missing love to support the ten commandments that's given instead you feel aborted taking a fall is the only way to start until you left out at sea drifting on Noah's ark and aw quiet as you listen for her call till the kraken emerges and surely submerge you al but so what this world is disgusting Im appalled who are you to judge me when you are so flawed I don't get it, it never felt right that's why i fell in love with misery attracted to the light so ill follow his command as it leads me hopefully to a place where ill receive peace"

The theorys, opinions, and beliefs expressed are not the only possible interpretations. The viewer is invited to make a judgement based on all alvailable information.

For some it's a spiratual ____?___, and for other's, evil is a very real presence, a physical entity, of terrifying power. What is evil? Is it mearly a dictionary definition for wrong or bad, or is it something more, a deeper, darker force that makes people perform cruel or inhuman acts. Does an evil force really exsist that can attract and then control the actions of human beings, or is evil nothing more than a convenient excuse for deviant and destructive behavior. These are questions without easy answer's and are continually debated by those who study the human mind and the human sprirt. (5 or 6 dudes debating evil)"

Cling to false, also those papers say ock. I got tired of the fat lady so I sing to my own opera. Ba-lang-balang-balang-to-de-man-de-rock-'cause I love thee. If you live by the sword, you will be die by the gun, 'Cause all guys tell lies, and more girls commits it. I was ordered to code red, but now I'm chillin' with a few good men. Assassination on the kid from the capitol. I never play the soap opera, but now I'm a general hospital. Condition critical, spirit over who's the physical. So if I die, catch me at the funeral. I'll fly away, oh glory, With a mic in my hand, to a land where only God knows me, And the angels write raps on holy paper. I said: I'm lookin for Jesus, he said: take the escalator One flight up, is guaranteed you'll be there. My sister'd be there, my mother'd be there. So, Mona Lisa, could I get a date on Friday?

[Prazwell & Wyclef] Hey, yo, a battle is a battle but a battle's not a battle. If it's snake doesn't rattle, 'Cause my style's as old as a reptile. As slick as a new Nile, as new as a new child. So come follow me to the land of Abraham. This land's your land, this land's my land. The blacker the black man, the better the next man. (Yo, some nappy heads need to check they necks for red.) I feel injection, Put the needle to your skin, feel reality's heroin. You maintain to put a negro in pain, you used to diss me. ""Oh, you want to hang with old Eddie Kane?"" (The Five Heartbeats.) Ain't nuttin' wrong, snap your head to the song. Word is bond, you get wrong, I'll have you sing like Louis Armstrong. And I say to myself, what a wonderful world, But what the hell was so wonderful 'bout cotton in the farm? Mr. Slave Man! The harder they come, the harder they fall, so come one, come all. Don't stall or I'm a stick you like a voodoo doll. Doors locked, stop drawer for the count, who drops. You slept on a kid from the boondocks, Out of Motorville land of the ill kill. Bellsburg Viking, so you know I'm top ranking, Phil. Some say who coming, like, like the yuma, but save the rumor, 'Cause I've been rockin' ever since eighty-two, When I used to rock my Pumas A cheeba cheeba y'all, well, I'm a Libra, y'all.

Hip-Hop,"[Dead men tell no tales. Up push the daisies till the soil is stale In a powder blue tux for the farmer's sale Mr. big sleep with the carp and kelp] Once upon a time in the days of yore When the people lived fresh outta legend and folklore There was an old pirate who piloted vile slang Had a bird perched on him and swash buckled the same Peg leg navigator starboard to port By the nautical star of male an the harbor is yours And you should tell them where you situate the gold That is unless you'd like a vacation with Davy j-j-j-Jones. Like ""walk the plank"" for whom the shark thank Maroon the mutineers consume the souvenirs. Come all the shiny spoils piled higher every year He was suffocating slow in the box of a buccaneer Ten summers prior on a night like this Crows nest scopes something afloat to the boats west Swore it blew him a kiss When he focus seen the face of an angel upon the body of a F-f-f-fish. ""What the heck!"" grabbed for his telescope Shatter gathered himself she was ghost he was down the rope ladder To deck circled the vessel the 360 swiftly Found nothing in the water but salt, piss and whiskey. Yarr, heckled by the swabbies at the bar, He'll be the laughing stock of the barbary coast war Like this dude either got two glass eyes Or he wearing his patch on the wrong s-s-s-side Now he knew what he saw But had to prove he was raw So he raped and he pillaged and And he'd feud and he'd brawl Try to rekindle his rep via sabers and gun smoke And battle always find him though he never told cutthroats Meanwhile, back in the now, Got a brand new skeleton crew On the move out When they aren't manning thirty burning cannons stern and bow They are prying shiny metals out your m-m-m-mouth Okay, youth wanes old age holler wisdom and disease Like the scurvy made his yellow gums bleed. And he was aching from his boots to the feather in his cap Till his quartermaster showed up with a stolen treasure map One look down and lept off the dock, See if you can guess where X marked the spot The capital was buried at sea in a cursed cave, Only one mile from where he'd seen the mer-mer-mer-maid. Anchors up, hoist the jolly roger thank you much. Day and night with his hook hands raised and clutched But see the vitamin deficiency was strong So by the time they bumped into the island he could barely lift his grog Crawled off the boat, collapsed in the sand Prayers in the air, seashells in his hand An area high tide so grand it's the one that put the one that put The lady of the lake on dry la-la-la-land I wish I could tell you that it ended happy Pretend like his bones weren't practically snapping Pretend like her gills didn't dry up and suffer But that's a half-dead pirate and a fish outta water. No lie, scout's honor, got a million more From the burgundy lighting above the shores of whores Before your visions of grandeur go to slow those sails Remember that dead men tell no t-t-t-tales"

Hip-Hop,"Yes! Yes! Thank you for inviting me here for my final speech. Ladies and gentlemen, homosexuals, lesbians, and transvestites, Allow me to introduce myself as the Hungry Hustler, Afroman. I am the American Dream. Even though the government tried to experiment with me By placing me in the projects, I'm still the American Dream. Surrounded by drugs, Jeopardized my life by living around thugs, But I'm still the American Dream. Kicked outta Palmdale High School Because I was considered a distraction to the educational process. I've traveled through the complete metamorphosis of the justice system, And I'm still the American Dream. Entered Juvenile Hall as a tadpole; Hopped outta prison as a bull frog, But I'm still the American Dream. The most rejected, disrespected, When I went for a job I was never selected, But I am still the American Dream. And right about now, I find it quite serendipitous to see that all of you some-timin', Wishy-washy, two-faced, back-stabbin', Coniving hypocrites have accumulated here in my midst to persecute my character With such flagrant slanderousity, But I counter-attack by calling it constructive criticism, And all of your negativity has been recycled into motivation, And I am still the American Dream. Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now I'm found; was blind, but now I see. There's a lot of people out there who can identify with me. Young lady right here, you may be a single teenaged mother, But you are still the American Dream. The lady next to you, yes. Your breasts may not be as big as men think they should be, But you are still the American Dream. Young man, you may not be a baller, shot caller, With 20 inch blades on the impala, but you are still the American Dream. Young man right here, you may have spent all your money on a hood rat bitch And didn't get no pussy last night, but you are still the American Dream. Yes sir, I am just like Ham. I'm for the black man, The mexican, and even poor white, All human beings that have no rights. So put down your past, pick up your future, Follow me as we journey through the Red Sea, Cause I have been to the mountain top, I've seen the Promised Land, Mine eyes have seen the glory of the Underground Category. My mind has been delivered. My spirit has been reinstated from the Corporate World's modern-day slavery. I've been emancipated. Free at last! Free at last! Fuck a drug test, I'm fittin' to roll some grass. Love, peace, and Afro grease, Fro-ever! Buccooocc! A-E-I-O-you, and sometimes W. 'cause I'm high, 'cause I'm high, 'cause I'm high."

Hip-Hop,"Sometimes people say things that they don't really mean. They just might call you names to lift their self esteem. But soon enough, they'll realize that it'll never work. Because inside they're trying to hide how much they really hurt. But as long as you know who you are and what you're about Nothing they say can shake your pride and make you doubt The beauty you have in you and when they give attitude you can tell them like this. Say, I'm beautiful and spiritual and I think it's about time to tell you this. I'm gonna be the best me that I know how to be. One day you learn how much it means to believe in yourself. So take these words and share these words to help somebody else. You never know. Anything's possible. You just might make a friend. So when they try to make you cry, tell them again and again. Say it like this- I'm beautiful and spiritual and I think it's about time to tell you this. I'm gonna be the best me that I know how to be. Say it again my brother, I'm beautiful and spiritual and I think it's about time to tell you this. I'm gonna be the best me that I know how to be. I'm beautiful and I'm spiritual and I think it's about time to tell you this. I'm gonna be the best me that I know how to be."

Cause boy I waited up for you ten thousand days But you never came And boy I gave it up to ten thousand ways But you didn't stay So am I in love Or am I just mad? So am I in love Or am I just mad? I can see that you will never change So either I am lonely or insane... And maybe that's the thing that I can't face Having to refill that empty space Maybe there's a seed inside my pocket Maybe a garden I should grow? I shouldn't hold on, I should just stop it, I should just let it go I know... I know I gotta face the mirror sometime And I gotta look me in the eye, saying Girl you waited up for him ten thousand days And he never came And girl you gave it up to him ten thousand ways But he didn't stay So no more love Driving you mad Thats not love Your better then that...

And how could I fall to the violence of hell and still remain sane? And how could I still remain on top of my game? When both the black and white devils seek the power to rebel Seek to defy my radiance, I shift gears to another level I'm focused, but it's like I'm playin a cold hand of spades I got a lot of hearts, but these fools tryin to cut me and I'm tired of these jokers Vengeance is mine, I plague the whole planet with locusts I survived the mayhem, my advantage I've been the brokest I wasn't drugged and inhaled by all the smokers Then I became the love absorbed by all the cultures I can't trust women because my heart was scorned It's hard to trust yo' comrades, when yo' heart was torn One-nine-seven-oh the God was born..

All my enemies and critics complain They swear that one day I'll pay for my sinister ways It's really a shame; penny earned, penny was saved Career hit a spike head on, Phineas Gage, bitch"
Hip-Hop,"The room is all silent your eye lids are shut, You begin crying, saying why aint I good enough Tears running down your cheeks, 2 trails of mascara dripping off your face to your feet, All of a sudden you fall to your knees, Your body starts shaking and its making it... hard for you to breathe. Your minds playing tricks on yah, Wishing its a bad dream cause usually never happens to yah. Then youre phone rings, you know its him calling, you dont want to listen to his side of the story. You hear a lot of rumors, no way they aint true! Even though the person that told you the news only assume that whatever he did made sense that he cheated! From Every phone calls, texts, numbers you deleted Came fat lies, you didnt need to hear, but the source that you got it from is someone that is dearest to you! Chorus I dont want start again, but it feels like the end. Wasnt I good enough? See then why dint you give it up? Why did you make me choose? This is the hardest thing Ive ever had to do, But I gotta let u go and leave my tears! The room was all silent, you hear the bell ring, you put away everything, youre books and youre pens den u standup say excuse me can I pass? Smile on your face cause it was your last exam, Head to the cafeteria to meet friends, ask about the craziest night on the weekend, chat about who hooked up with who, Over hearing a name of someone dearest to you You start thinking Tell the girls keep talking Feeding you more info getting deeper in the story Then you clicked They talking about youre cousins boyfriend hooking up with someone so up in the open, leaving you in a position where you gotta tell her, you scared to though Cause you know that it will damage her but you do. You let her know everything from the start to finish making up the story from what you assume happened. Chorus I dont want start again, but it feels like the end. Wasnt I good enough? See then why dint you give it up? Why did you make me choose? This is the hardest thing Ive ever had to do but I gotta let u go And leave my tears! The room is all silent you open your eyes Your head starts pounding by the rays of the sunshine. Trying to remember what happened in your room, you still smelling alcohol and some ladies perfume. Flashbacks of you taking a few shots, taking a girl home in the risk, black spots, you begin to panic cause you know you in the wrong, 10 missed calls and messages on your phone You get scared. The butterflies start creeping, tryna ring yah girl, you assume shes sleeping. Still no answer, you can hear yourself breathing. The pace starts picking up of your heart beating Wishing that you were never put in this drunk state. You feel the buzz on your phone cause its on vibrate, a text in your inbox saying that she knows! Now I guess that you knows how the story goes... Chorus I dont want start again, but it feels like the end. Wasnt I good enough See then why dint you give it up? Why did you make me choose? This is the hardest thing Ive ever had to do but I gotta let u go And leave my tears!"

Hip-Hop,"I shall not fear no man but God Though I walk through the valley of death I shed so many tears (if I should die before I wake) Please God walk with me (grab a nigga and take me to Heaven) Back in elementary, I thrived on misery Left me alone I grew up amongst a dyin' breed Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest Tell me can you feel me? I'm not livin'' in the past, you wanna last Be tha first to blast, remember Kato No longer with us he's deceased Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets Now rest in peace Is there heaven for a G? Remember me So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears Ah, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen And fuck the world cause I'm cursed, I'm havin' visions Of leavin'' here in a hearse, God can you feel me? Take me away from all the pressure, and all the pain Show me some happiness again, I'm goin' blind I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin'' well I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail? My life is in denial, and when I die, Baptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears Lord, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer To embrace an early death, now there's nothin'' left There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest I'm barely standin', bout to go to pieces, screamin' peace And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game No memories, just a misery Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin'' me, in my sleep Will I survive til the mo'nin, to see the sun Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come Lord, I suffered through the years (God) and shed so many tears God, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears Lord knows I, tried, been a witness to homicide Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die Wonder why as I walk by Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high This ain't the life for me, I wanna change But ain't no future right for me, I'm stuck in the game I'm trapped inside a maze See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady Don't trust my lady, cause she's a product of this poison I'm hearin' noises, think she fuckin' all my boys, can't take no more I'm fallin' to the floor; beggin' for the Lord to let me in To Heaven's door, shed so many tears (Dear God, please let me in) Lord, I've lost so many years, and shed so many tears I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears Lord, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears God, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears"

Hip-Hop,"Broken cars, old guitars Waiting here for the time to pass, Time takes it toll - it took it fast Secret meetings at the rivers bend Simple days when I called you friend Came a time, we went separate ways Those were our young years Our wings were drying in the sun Now the winter, at our window feels so cold Where are our young years Everything seemed better days Boats in which we sailed away Lie all rusted on rocky ground Here we sit with a schooner of ale Dreaming of a wind thatll make us sail Taking us far away Do you remember how it was? We had the moon and tide behind us We used to take it up take it up! Those were our young years Our wings were drying in the sun Now the winter, at our window feels so cold Back in our young years Sometimes the good did not die young Now we live on memories alone Of our young years If we had the moon and tide behind us We could still sail so far away And time would pass And things would change And memories would fade away Those were our young years Our wings were drying in the sun Now the winter, at our window feels so cold Back in our young years Sometimes the good did not die young Now we live on memories alone Those were our young years You know well live it all again We can turn the tide and sail away Back to our young years Those were our young years"

Hip-Hop,"Verse 1 I settle back in the afternoon, Munchin' on lemonade and macaroons Letting the Panasonic blast a tune, Feeling lovely, Bullsh*t can never touch me, A hard day's work - shower up - a n*gga must be, Fresh and clean, Splash the neck, smell good, Pop the collar scholar cause I'm knockin on wood, Good luck will follow, let's cop a bottle, Let's live today, promised day tomorrow, Listen to wise words, Two sips, calmin' my nerves, Put the drink down, front tires hittin' the curb, Steppin' outta the car, Cise Starr - the realest, Nothin' but the truth, My presence will hurt feelins', Livin' it up, not a balla, but still maintain, Gettin' my self ready mang, Go slow, change lanes... (Swervin' from lane to lane, Movin the second gear side to side) Chorus (X2): The daily grind got me up in a rat race, But now I'mma pull over, pit stop and change pace, Gotta get a breather, or else I'll either, Fall down and get back up and maintain... Verse 2: It's like a cool drink of water, on a hot day refreshin', I'm in your area, town, neighborhood and section, Money left over after bills is a blessin', So now I'm out on the town, eternal reflection, Comin' out with speakers, Right before Ether, I need ya, After this track, Bahamadia, Makin a mix, Hearin' '96 through the stereo, F*ck the radio, As I slide through your barrio(district), Drivin' a long, Hopin' the traffic is gone, Turn it up and push repeat because it's my favorite song, Coldplay what the soul say, I'm singin' a long, Parachutin' out the sky track number 2 is on, Vibin' the music, Lettin my whole mind loose it, I'm never around Judas, I'm a man of my word, From bullets outta the heater, This beats out of the speaker, Reach out, outta your corner and embrace the world, Stress on the nerves, Reactin' when I swerve, But f*ck it, I'm stayin' steady, do you know what you heard? Wisdom out of the tooth, The elders speakin' to youth , I'm sittin' back in the booth just recitin' my words, Chorus (x2) (It's time to chill, I know you feel me.) (Back it...and maintain.)"
Hip-Hop,"Take a breath, say you love me We both know that everything changes Keep in mind that none of this is fiction This is just a glimpse into the head of a menace We were two different children But we born of the same moon Blowing entire opposite We were brought up the same too I used to hate you because they celebrate you And you made them notice every single thing I can't do But really I honestly wanted to be you And I just hope my desire to wasn't that see through I never took into account the things that you were hiding I even understood your rage when I see you get violent I guess the height of all my envy was leaving me blinded Until you sat me down and told me how crazy your life is You said to run and never look back And if I did, to never lose track of all the hurdles I was jumping That lead me to my current goal Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold Took a chance, said you'd love me We both know that everything changes You found me when I was dying and unappreciated You broke me down into a science that I completely hated You told impeccable talent didn't make me less average But how I use it to my advantage determined my passion It took some time to understand and manage But then I learned this passion was the method to my madness And I never got to thank you, at least not in the way I planned But I had to learn before I did that, I hope you understand It takes a lot for me to bury hatchets but consider them cremated All the ashes burned to ashes And I'm dusting off my vocal box and finally saying thank you And even though you ain't my fan, you did the shit they ain't do So disregard my temper and the times I fucking hate you Because despite all my ignorance I'm really fucking grateful Never forget the importance of the sparks you hold Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold Took a glance, towards the mirror Now I know that everything changes I used to hate me, I swore my life was too painful Let my demons overtake me before I fight with my angels There was constantly a struggle to see my life at an angle That provided understanding of how much drama could change you I used to cut myself open just to feel like I was living But when living is just dying then there's no longer a difference There's no longer existence, and there's no longer persistence And there's no longer a drive there existing on only division And I thought, if nobody ever loved me This vacancy inside me must be really called a bloodstream Then I looked into the world and saw a million people like me Probably never know your stories, but you're the reason I'm fighting You're the reason I'm writing; music Could be so reviving And if ever you tend to forget, I'm right here to remind you: Don't ever give into the hurt you hold Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold Don't sell your soul baby you are dirty gold"

And then they pulled my file and found all sorts of crimes I said it once I said it twice I said it three times They asked me how do I plead I said not guilty They gettin angry they wanna hang me The victims parents thought the cops should've killed me They called me the devil and threw holy water on me Order in the court its gettin outta hand How do I plead to homicide They got an eye witness and she's bout to take the stand Now I start to panic the truth and my lies collide The eye witness took the stand she said she saw me burnin candles Then she heard a shot and saw my hand with the hammers handle They seen blood and guts and called the cops on me And when they came brain fragments all over the room The judge and jury lookin at me like guilty They one jumped up and said (Lock up the filthy bastard!) God damn can I get a god damn break How much shit can one black man take But the judge is black and the jury too Show me a throat and I'ma cut through All of 'em lookin at you know who They said the killing was a satanic ritual They asked me why did I do it I said fuck you Then they called me a sick individual I dropped my head and tried to plead insanity As you can see he's a threat to humanity With no emotion in my face I saw her family cry And since I'm guilty that's how I'm pleadin to homicide

Hip-Hop,"I was a dark dumb student, no hokey rookie daytrippin on visions of chickens that looked like R Crumb drew em. They grew em in the royal dirt of Suffolk Countys flooring with the blood of an alcoholic clergyman in his forearms. Long Island was porn stars and puppies pushing sniffles, fit into the eighth dimension or slipped through the pin holes, ?zoop? slipped through the pin holes, ?crisped into god cinder?. Who thunk over a quarter plunked a local ?mortal con? vendor. Who broke the verbal squad sensor? Root down, feelers out across the marsh before it was Awesome Car! I called in car cavalry cooked in an 85 Dodge Aries, gas for Huntington and back barely. Equipped with super soakers full of piss and an uncanny knack for constantly upsetting pigs by doing stupid shit. The kid ?bartered? his ring king dummies to King Cullen where they hollered Fuck the World from a parking lot of the suburbs. A couple spray cans and a little litter, but theyd look at us like swindlers with them Ricky Kasso jitters. So fuck em, a glutton sunk into the alley for props but things will still go bump when them halogens pop. Believe. Ill be there when it happens so shake another place off the mantel, snake another flames off the candle, lady of the lake off the answers, admitting their mistakes to their ?deplaning? cadavers. Now its rest in peace when Peters ?sinner heaters sung? disturbingly referred to reevaluate your beast of burdens urgency. Damn doggy, good times, thanks. I wrote your name in wet cement by the Brooklyn banks. Chorus ?...Smack? for later. Made a fire, made a wheel, made a snack for later. Catacomb kids cuddle up and test the paper. When the town's speed freaks sleep, trap the traitor. He will ask for papers. ?See Im a nice invader?, made a roof, made a weapon, made a flag from paper by the snotty little nuzzle of a latchkey neighbor. When the ?pope does shaggy? over some dap from gators, he will catch the vapors. Couple Playboy mudflaps and hell on his heels. Blew the plea echoed in a pace with your shovelers meals, like not a farmer among us had a harvest survive the winter. So dinner is split a lima bean in triplets. Pick a winner. We took a couple of summers puking pills behind the dumpster, it was the largest Pez dispenser on record recouped his numbers. One shoe in the soupy gutter, one shoe in the velvet heaven. When the mermaids haul em, shake em up the lake with a ?melted weapon secret?. Dance ?Prudey? with the rule of a nation, who will be patient, awaiting zookeeper facelift extra. The days of your pain and similar uber apeshit, we merely updated the ancient apage. Yeah, dumber than a gal on a roof in a flood, whos not as dumb as the watered down beef from the burgers that jumped. Im dumber than a Taz on a beach chair with a Martini, whos not as dumb as a tat with the same scenery. ?Walking female? pig stigmata for all good sport. Garbage Pail Kids unite at the mall food court. Chase cheese fries with binaca. They had shut the school down early, there were bombs inside the lockers. No concept of the problem, we responded like a snow day, it was clobber shit to flotsam but the cops said it was OK. OK so the squadrons back into their boxes like its breakfast club of hotheads show no progress to the doctors. And I walk into the office, cough an awful ether often, flood a parking meter fever, knuckle up the love and rockets. It was reign of the razor laser, day of the cloudy howdy, flight of the shelter melter, you can bow without me. Chorus Knock em out the box, Aes."

Hip-Hop,"So now you wanna know, But where was you when I was broke? Now I see love you've never shown, So why you think I'm bading? I almost swear I made it. So fuck them, they don't go as hard as me, Who's be coming at the ill? Fuck them, I'm a disease. I put my money where my mouth is, They be lying through their teeth, Our window be mistaken, I still ache like a pagan. So fuck them, they don't go as hard as me, I don't raise the bar so high, no satellite can find me, They can keep chasing their dreams until I clap them out the sleeve Gets pissed that they faded, my name they been cremated. Lies. You've been guessing out them hoes, which are bullshit, 'cause you've been kissing on your balls with your small dick. Look, I got my willy up. And the camera's on, but now you call me wrong on life, that's why Harry's on. Door signs and a proof big, two times my hun' I ain't shutting off my time, I'm just letting my shit hang on light Off the size of red cage I saw nine in like drizzy This time I'd be on the game like Chris Brizzi did to Ree-Ree. That's just D A to P P Y, I'm doing me G Them ring tone rappers ain't got no credit, if one rings around, that brings one later.

'cause no one cares about what the fuck was made in Chelsea, The only way is the streets, don't care what no one tells me, Skied off, once in, two shots, none left. Ten men, one pet. Ten times there? Pussy roll on my carpet, 'cause the king of the jungle just tore that piece out the market, They talking shit on the record, then why exhaust? Doing us the dirty thing, is time to flush, 'cause the fucking thing's on it. You solve it, you finish all, you dickheads be quiet, I'm starving my face and I'm taking pussy, you on a diet. You the type to go to Gucci? They caught up high just to try it, They got picture, post it on Twitter and don't even buy You don't hustle, you just listen to nipsy, The only strap you only see is on the top of your kick I go jump once before and you can even nor stinchy, I got them on my shit back, and it wasn't my fish, You see my chains link to my pride if you take what comes to my life We get our sign, not even my toilet will let shit slide Now let that book in mine and bring that pair around with that dick If you only see the shape of that clip, suck it, I'm your prick. So now you wanna know, But where was you when I was broke? Now I see love you've never shown, So why you think I'm bading? I almost swear I made it.

Hip-Hop,"Ninelives, Deuce, lets go. Chorus: Im supposed to be the one who brings us all together, weak or strong, not just a song we sing along when things go wrong. You will need me when you fall, and I will need you when Im wrong. Tears lead me on, they let me lead you so far. Weak or strong, Ill hold your arm. I see the sickness in the signs, the dead weight in line, like the sickness on my mind, homosexuals and liars. Fuck praying for reasons. Fuck praying for Jesus. Let me shine like a god, like a leader. Ill burn a hole through your cross, my souls already lost and its funny, cause theyre saying hes hot. But they dont see the fuckin tears that Ive cried, and they dont hear me when I scream when I die. I wanna live good, I wanna live right, my insecurities are eatin me alive, I need to find someone close to my heart thatll help me through my struggles, you can help me find the light. Chorus I already found the Devil, hes my best friend, he taught me how to leave, but I dont wanna end. Id want a pill for every bad thought, for every chick Ive fucked, for every time I lost. Dont think Im broken, cause Im not, got milk? got problems? problems is all that I got. Youre looking down on a barrel of a bent pole, take my hand, I promise that Ill go slow. When you look to close, you end up with a broke soul; cause in the end its dark where all the souls go. Maybe you can show me how to live right, and come see how it all ends wrong. Chorus Ill take you to a place so warm, like the insides of a baby-unborn. The Bible keeps telling me dont go. They dont know what I know. What. You will reap what I saw. What. You will cease when I blow. Yup. I wont leave when you go. Nope. Come with me, let us go home. Chorus"

Who's satisfied doing good deeds anymore? Who grieves anymore? Who believes anymore? Who graduated school and still reads anymore? Not me, That should have my whole race shook, Cause we don't read novels, But we do face book, The new craze is having that new age look, If I said I liked it I'd feel like a 2 faced crook, Nah, I tell retro kids: ""Tie that bandana just a little bit tighter til it suficates you biter"" Cuz i dont wear bright colors or rope chains, I'm a G my daddy was in the dope game"

If it was up to me I would pass the baton 'cause it's tough to lead But still I drop facts here and there so I can up the seed So you must believe X-Files Lots of rappers today depend on imagery I myself depend on skills and my energy It's maddening at every single gathering Of young black youth it's got to be some niggers badgering Averaging out to be 'bout three out a G Now motherfuckers build stereotypes 'cause it's all they see I take glee in the fact that I'm me Not a follower, a dollar wouldn't make me sell my soul Del is old-school compared to your subterfuge I got the same code of ethics Jungle Brothers use Now, every nigger wanna be crime related Can't rhyme creative and they're made of self-hatred That's why they overstep boundaries that's sacred From the street to the corporate scene they all mean business Self for self, phony doesn't work Your soul holds no weight when you let the Devil lurk Fighting evildoers I been evil myself But I'm still a black man with experience under my belt I may be young but my soul is old Living in the ice ages where a nigga's soul is cold Don't give a fuck about your life or his But if you get a gat for protection, who lives? Comin' up ain't the same as pullin' everybody else down But try telling that to niggers that are spellbound They'll probably say that you talk too much They gotta think too much So just be careful who you trust Del, what you got up your sleeve? If it was up to me I would pass the baton 'cause it's tough to lead But still I drop facts here and there so I can up the seed So you must believe Del, what you got up your sleeve? If it was up to me I would pass the baton 'cause it's tough to lead But still I drop facts here and there so I can up the seed So you must believe X-Files, X-Files, peace"

Hip-Hop,"[Chorus] Hard times got my mind in bind. I'll go crazy tryin' to climb out the grime that's in my life (my life). I'm surprised I survived. It's amazin'! (amazin') I'm alive, I got by with my life! Every time I look around it seem Like I'm in trouble, pressured by the devil. Lord I love You and I really trust You. Wish that I could hug You. Disappear from the grain and the rubble And I'm tryin' to keep from going under. We ride, Eastside, blowin' in the wind. Each time I try, they lie, no lie! Judgin' from the outside lookin' in. Never had a clue of what Id really do. The ghetto pushin' through, but I'm a do it right. Never buckle, never stop to struggle! Layzie gotta muscle through the pressure, Bust pipes, my life, highlights, Bright lights, all right! Story of a warrior. My flight, final destination, thug motivation, Time never wastin', pacin' my stride. Tryin' to get it good! Feel the hustle and flow. You know we are them mighty soldiers. Had it been for all the shit we been through And doin' whatever but God surely knows. So here we are steady on the go. Its too late cause we been through crazy. Everyday seem to bring a twist That take us on a loop but we don't let it phase. Raisin these babies through it. We never run away from responsibility, but where you goin'? Youre gonna have to face the music anyway. Livin' through a true reality but you be blowin'!. If they test you make em feel the pressure, Let off some aggression and yo the flesh Will really give em something to stress, More likely even less. [Chorus] My life! (My life) Lil' nigga bailin' through the hood, Livin' crooked like I could. Get cha for your goods! Make it understood! Put it on the wood! Nigga what! (what!) I used to have to grind in the dough. Did a little time in the poke. A couple wicked rhymes That I wrote really helped a nigga shine with my folks. Cause, nigga, I was broke. Eazy heard us go. And Eazy said, Whoa, yall niggas dope! Five niggas loc, five killer flows, y'all finna blow! So temptation made us sign the papers overnight sensation! Clearly chasing satan. Niggas really famous. Got a lot of haters, calling us the greatest, Number one and can't nobody fade us! Got that top spot (done did it, done did it) And then came back fallin' down. (down) I don't know what happened? What happened? Why did Eazy die? Whats wrong with Bizzy? He alright! Is Flesh really comin' home? Is Bizzy comin' home? Just wish he'd come and take Henny the dome! I'm so high, stay faded. (faded) Might feel a little better but the pain stays there. Its OK, the real gotta spike. Everywhere we go, the hood ? They can relate to the fight, the real from the fake. Sound good hes alive. [Chorus] As I wake up early in the morning. Light my cigarette and wake up all my bitches. Take a shower, quickly tell The Lord I love Him! Didn't invite the devil cause I gave him ? evil. I never ever thought I'd keep my candles-lit up, Get em' hit em' get em' ? Bizzy! Nobody know my struggle nor my hustle. I'm a certified rider! Gave up all my children. Women in my shit and dipping, Now you know the Lord is always with me that's my only weapon. Talk to every sinner Bless em'. Then I raise my seven ? and I don't give a fuck either! Television celebratin Livin ? Every now and then I'm chillin'. Nigga this is my life and I'm a live it And give it right back to God. Now listen!"

[Verse 1] Gotta keep pushing and we only inspire do we tire? No just acting like an umpire in life, Tryna get my own empire, and retire at 21, I can't believe this shit it's not really fun, We got the mechanics of the game and the firm, Gotta have an impact like the Eric Serm and Ima be the bread winner, Lottery ticket's a sinner, Now these bitches wanna suck me off with the racks on racks, Building it up with tracks on tracks, Eating rappers up just like how Pacman acts so I just stop and I really wanna say this, Check it like Warren when I regulate Gotta go and separate, Spending the money on a place with hella space, I heard you on that lil diss track you pretty wack, Can't even believe an amateur forgot how to act, Sit back with the Beatles, doing this activity legal, And never give up in whatever you do, Trust me I've had my moments of doubt too, But I keep on spraying and spitting, Slaying and ripping, Never trippin' off competition. [Chorus] [Verse 2] Fucken got a lot of Hip Hop in my heart, You missed out I've been here from the very very start, And Ima spit a lil bit faster, Until you learn like the Blast Master, Always been good but not a pastor, Now let me slow it down a little, Never belittle or give up in the middle, of signing the best deal in your life, And then you fuck a tour and a mic, Just get a hoe and a wife, But wait the money supposed to come first, Prepare for the worst, Fuck the hearse and just stay up on your thirst, Just letting it be, Went to your house and now I really see, damn Pac said he gon' change the world for free, Come back next year and then he do it for me, Pool party when the sun go down, Lil fun when your bitch come around, Bedroom at the dawn of night, Sloppy head is what I like, And fuck college just sticking to the mic, Rather be my own boss and I'm holding it tight, No one screaming or chanting, Harassing or laughing, Becoming the phantom, Always be hopeful forever, whenever damn.

Don't interrupt me as I struggle to complete this thought Have some respect for someone more forgetful than yourself And I'm not done And I won't be till my head falls off Hitting every pocket on my shirt, pants and overcoat And I'm hitting them again but I don't know where I put my notes Clearing my throat, and gripping the lectern I smile and face my audience Clearing his throat and smiling with his hands on the bathroom sink And when I lean my head against the frosted shower stall I see stuff through the glass that I don't recognize at all And I'm not done And I won't be till my head falls off Though it may not be a long way off I'm not done talking yet I'm not done talking yet And when I lean my head against the frosted shower stall I see a broken figure silhouetted on the wall And I'm not done And I won't be till my head falls off Though it may not be a long way off I won't be done until my head falls off"

Red Rum got to get me some, Bloody Mary, now my body's numb. I go, you go, The serpent and the rainbow. Adam and Eve, I believe, Pickin' fruit off the wicket trees. Will I bite? I just might, If I do then I'm through. Lord forgive me, how I lived, How's your wife, and my kids? I did the crime, I'll do the time, White man trapped inside my mind, Adam and Eve, Jesus Christ, Elvis Presley, Vincent Price. Nappy hair, black sheep, In wolf's clothing, it's all deep. Prophecies, comin' true, Something you all never knew. Will you love me, will you hate me? Would you let your daughter date me? Where would I take her out on a date? We'll go knockin' on heaven's gates. The President wants me dead, For some of those things I said. Heaven's gates, the White House gates, Water Gates, paper plates. Look inside your dollar bill, In God we trust, if you will, The pyramid is the great seal. And all that stuff they had to steal. Black man runnin' through six degrees, The Bible in his hands, still on his knees. Still got to ask the other man, please, Gimme powder milk, and welfare cheese. (Chorus 4x) If this ain't hell, I can't tell, Sell my soul inside my cell. Washington, Redskins, Black skins, let me in. Welfare in DC, The President says vote for me. If I do, it seems odd, How one man, becomes God. White House, White man, God is money so understand. His plans, master plan, Is to kill off the black man, Jewish man, China man, It really don't matter with gun in hand. War sucks, big bucks, Tell me they don't give a fuck.

Between(New Orleans!) 1825(And New York!) 1992(Washington!) 1776(Miami!) 1995 In Cut City, There are no black people left, There are no black people left in Cut City!

There's no answer Blow the re-up on a dancer Down to fuck for money but I'm to scared to chance her Hit the DJ booth to get my songs spint Talking ""Just Touched Down"" but my flight got cancelled With a bottle in my hand, it's pretty much gone Take a slow sip, tryna pretend that I'm on With these 'sace shades, buck 50 soakin wet, With the heart of a lion but my pockets of a wretch And that's before your favorite rapper said he was a vet I didn't have muscle to pull I couldn't stretch to the finish line While you was eating breakfast it was dinner time For a pro nigga go getter Young nigga face but the soul of a old nigga Grew up to be just like my pops and it shows, nigga Rap name fixed But then there was a whole lot of ""Who the fuck is this?"" A whole lot of cursing: ""Who the fuck is KRIT?"" Another acronym that don't stand for shit And when it comes to names that's as bad as it gets Fast forward ten years, now who don't know KRIT? Two albums on the shelf, I beat the sophomore jinx I lost a few friends over ends, we don't speak I'm thinking this must be what God really want for me Top floor reminiscing, lord I can't sleep Like, what happens if I close my eyes and it's all a dream And I'm backin that telly on Martin Luther King Tryna make a difference Caught up in my feelings, lord why they won't listen? Riding with my partner and he riding dirty I'm kinda scared, cause I know he ain't gonna take his charge He ain't prepared, and he'll have to face that And I just needed another ride to the race track I'm so thankful that them laws never pulled us over God took the wheel, cause neither one of us was sober Downing bottle after bottle just to make it better I survived the worst of it, now it's KRIT 4eva Multi"

Hip-Hop,"Ya know that's why man I be telling you all the time man you know LOVE That word love is a very serious thing and if you don't watch out I Tell ya That (Love's gonna get you) because a lot of people out here say ""I Love my Car"" or ""I love my chain"" or or ""I'm I'm just in love with that girl Over There"" so far all the people out there that fall in love with material Items We gonna bump the beat a lil' something like this I'm in junior high with a be	plus grade, At the end of the day I don't hit the arcade, I walk from school to my moms apartment, I got to tell the sucaks everyday ""don't start it"", Cause where I'm at if your soft your lost, To say on course means to roll with force, A boy named Rob is chillin in a Benz, In front of my building with the rest of his friends, I give him a pound, oh I mean I shake his hand, He's the neighborhood drug dealer, my man, I go upstairs and hug my mother, Kiss my sister, and punch my brother, I sit down on my bed to watch some tv, (machine gun fire) do my ears deceive me, Nope, that's the fourth time this week, Another fast brother shot dead in the street, The very next day while I'm off to class, My moms goes to work cold busting her ass, My sisters cute but she got no gear, I got three pairs of pants and with my brother I share, See there in school see I'm made a fool, With one and a half pair of pant you ain't cool, But there's no dollars for nothing else, I got beans, rice, and bread on my shelf, Every day I see my mother struggling, Now its time I've got to do something, I look for work I get dissed like a jerk, I do odd jobs and come home like a slob, So here comes Rob he's cold and shivery, He gives me two hundred for a quick delivery, I do it once, I do it twice, Now there's steak with the beans and rice, My mother's nervous but she knows the deal, My sister's gear now has sex appeal, My brothers my partner and we're getting paper, Three months later we run our own caper, My family's happy everything is new, Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do, [Chorus] That's why, (loves gonna get you) (loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you) You fall in love with your chain, You fall in love with your car, Loves gonna sneak right up and snuff you from behind, So I want you to check the story out as we go down the line, (loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you) Money's flowing, everything is fine, Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine, Business is boomin' everything is cool, I pull about a g a week fuck school, A year goes by and I begin to grow, Not in height but juice and cash flow, I pick up my feet and begin to watch tv, Cause now I got other people working for me, I got a fifty five inch television you know, And every once in awhile I hear just say no, Or the other commercial I love, Is when they say, this is your brain on drugs, I pick up my remote control and just turn, Cause with that bullshit I'm not concerned, See me and my brother jump in the BM, Driving around our territory again, I stop at the light like a superstar, And automatic weapons cold sprayed my car, I hit the accelerator scared as fuck, And drove one block to find my brother was hit, He wasn't dead but the blood was pouring, And all I could think about was war and, Later I found that it was Rob and his crew, Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do, Ya know that's why, (loves gonna get you) (loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(love loves gonna get you) (loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you) (love loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you) That word love is very very serious(loves gonna get you) Very addictive My brothers out of it, but I'm still in it, On top of that I'm in it to win it, I can't believe that Rob would diss me, That faggot, that punk, he's soft a sissy, I'm driving around now with three of my guys, The war is on and I'm on the rise, We rolled right up to his favorite hang out, Said hello and then the bullets rang out, Some fired back so we took cover, And all I could think about was my brother, Rob jumped up and began to run, Busting shots hoping to hit someone, So I just stopped, and let off three shots, Two hit him and one hit a cop, I threw the gun down and began to shout, Come on I got him it's time to break out, But as we ran there were the boys in blue, Pointing their guns at my four man crew, They shot down one, they shot down two, Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do, (loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you) (love loves gonna get you) (loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you) (love loves gonna get you) (loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you), (loves gonna get you) (loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you) (love loves gonna get you) Ya know a lot of people believe that that word Love is real soft, but when You use it in your vocabulary like your addicted to it it sneaks right up And takes you right out. out. Out. Out. Out. So, for future reference remember it's alright to like or want a material Item, but when you fall in love with it and you start scheming and carrying On for it, just remember, it's gonna get'cha"

Show me some heart, walk through my hood after dark, dodgin' poison darts catch one in the left lung I hope that (? ? ?) by itself tracksmart. Act like a part of this you'll find yourself a victim of the rhyme bombarde'ment weak shit I have the tolerance. I write the best rhymes in my sleep. Dreamland beats and freelance techniques fuckin' up the sheets. Ink spots. Puss spot niggas tryin to stop this think not (get big not..?) and listen for your bank knock. We do a lot of this activity in my city, get a job in my world, join a futuristic commitee. Weak assistant of three had to be persistantly equal in order for it to work out in a balance which comes down to a question of natural talents. Cant keep those gifts isolated in tablets. It's not about rap ballads or who can flow the best, what kind of dressing you gonna have with your life salad? French...yes..thank you very much..On to the next (Slug) Yo you rappers eludin' but that's nothin' new. I still stick to my duty, to kick something true. Still if you wanna boo me we can do this in a circle of peers, tell your bitch to kick a beat so I can work you to tears. I've made a full of strangers throw hands in the air. I know you sense danger I can see it in your stare. Don't provoke anger when the mic's in my hand, cause if I get that spark i'm quick to rip apart your plans. Yo Ant, let's keep this one accesible. Take the fruits that wanna test these bros and make em' vegetables just to let em know that the course tastes pure. Pissed off all the local rappers so it's time to go on tour. I'm sure, so I never break a sweat when a fate steps instead I break that snake's neck and take his breath. Half the time half of em don't catch the rhymes they need they friends with to show em how we wax behinds. Please fool, hella stupid i'm assumin' probably couldn't even rock your own family reunion and i'm through with the politicket. Rhymesayers on a mission, watch the following thinkin', motherfucka (Mr. Gene Poole) I stick two fingers through his nostrils and a thumb through his mouth and swing em' like a bowling ball make em' strike the fuck out. Take a hook and stab it through his back and curve it around his spine and throw em out by the lili pads and wait for a hit on my line. Cause this rap shit makes me wanna catch niggas like catfish, chop em up into steaks and sop em up off the plate with biscuits and rice. I put the hand of the one that likes to hold mics in a vice, make sure he never writes in his life. When its time for me to display(stay the fuck out the way), and when its time for you to dj you gon' play what I say. The word for the day is Fette cash lessons. Get ready to mash when I give the word don't ask questions. Pack yo shit, dont smack yo bitch, leave peacebly cause these'll be vital elements of livin' feasibly. ? ? ? the urban ? ? mocha latte, Saint Paul nigga rockin the uptown partay like coca angel vatte, I provide that mental rush and that physical feelin like yo whole worlds being dusted.

Hip-Hop,"You are appreciated When I was young me and my mama had beef Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool With the big boys, breaking all the rules I shed tears with my baby sister Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama When things went wrong we'd blame mama I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell Hugging on my mama from a jail cell And who'd think in elementary? Hey! I see the penitentiary, one day And running from the police, that's right Mama catch me, put a whooping to my backside And even as a crack fiend, mama You always was a black queen, mama I finally understand For a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man You always was committed A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it There's no way I can pay you back But the plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated Lady Don't ya know we love ya? Sweet lady Dear mama Place no one above ya, sweet lady You are appreciated Don't ya know we love ya? Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along I was looking for a father he was gone I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs They showed a young brother love I moved out and started really hanging I needed money of my own so I started slanging I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks It feels good putting money in your mailbox I love paying rent when the rent's due I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you 'Cause when I was low you was there for me And never left me alone because you cared for me And I could see you coming home after work late You're in the kitchen trying to fix us a hot plate Ya just working with the scraps you was given And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving But now the road got rough, you're alone You're trying to raise two bad kids on your own And there's no way I can pay you back But my plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated Lady Don't ya know we love ya? Sweet lady And dear mama Place no one above ya, sweet lady You are appreciated Don't ya know we love ya? Pour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama And when it seems that I'm hopeless You say the words that can get me back in focus When I was sick as a little kid To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did And all my childhood memories Are full of all the sweet things you did for me And even though I act crazy I gotta thank the Lord that you made me There are no words that can express how I feel You never kept a secret, always stayed real And I appreciate, how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day Everything will be alright if ya hold on It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on And there's no way I can pay you back But my plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated Lady Don't ya know we love ya? Sweet lady And dear mama Place no one above ya, sweet lady You are appreciated Don't ya know we love ya? Sweet lady And dear mama Dear mama Lady, lady, lady"

Hip-Hop,"[Slug] He started running down the middle of the street Bare feet, looking like he needs a little to eat Broad daylight, the school kids are laughing at him It doesn't matter, he's battling a traffic jam A Pacman tryna come up a quarter Joystick, put your score in the corner Running from the ghosts till you get that pill Gotta hit the wall when you wanna stand still He's used to sell crack, years back I remember it was him and his weird fat cousin The last ones that you would've guessed at it Soundtrack was ""Black Planet"" and ""Sex Packets"" A long time ago in a hood that is still relatively close as the crow flies No time to grieve or bleed Tryna find a way to fulfill those needs [Chorus: 2X] Such temptation, what's the basis?

Because all of your hope is gone
And your life is filled with much confusion
Until happiness is just an illusion
And your world around is crumblin' down
Darling, reach out, come on girl, reach on out for me
Reach out, reach out for me
I'll be there, with a love that  will shelter you
I'll be there, with a love that will see you through

When you feel lost and about to give up
'Cause your best just ain't good enough
And you feel the world has grown cold
And you're drifting out all on your own
And you need a hand to hold
Darling, reach out, come on girl, reach out for me
Reach out, reach out for me
I'll be there, to love and comfort you
And I'll be there, to cherish and care for you
I'll be there, with a love that will see you through
I'll be there to love and comfort you

I can tell the way you hang your head
You're without love and now you're afraid
And through your tears you look around
But there's no peace of mind to be found
I know what you're thinkin'
You're alone now, no love of your own
But darling, reach out, come on girl, reach out for me
Reach out
Just look over your shoulder
I'll be there, to give you all the love you need
And I'll be there, you can always depend on me"
Jazz,"Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice
Warmer than a summer night
But clouds were like a alabaster palace
Rising to a snowing height
Each star its own aura borealis
Suddenly you held me tight
And I could see the midnight sun

I cant explain the silver ring that found
Or was that a moonlight vale
The music of the universe surround me
Or was it that a nightingale
And then your arms miraculously found me
Suddenly the sky turned pale
And I could see the midnight sun

Was there ever such a night
Its a thrill I still don't quite believe
But after you were gone
There was still some stardust on my sleeve
The flame of it may twiddle to remember
And the stars forget to shine

And we may see a meadow in December
I see white and crystal light
But oh my darling ill always remember
When your lips were close to mine
And we saw the midnight sun

The flame of it may twinkle like 
An amber in the stars forget to shine
And we may see a meadow in December
I see white and crystal light
But oh my darling ill always remember
When your lips were close to mine
And we saw the midnight sun
We saw the midnight sun

I can see the midnight sun, yeah
What a weekend"
Jazz,"Gonna get out my sycamore and shine up my shoes
Meet my baby and tell her the news
I bet my bundle on a swayback nag
And I came home winner with a plenty of swag

[Chorus]
One foot, two foot, slew foot, drag
Swing your honey to the Sugarfoot Rag
Dig a little jig with a zig and a zag
And listen to the guitar play the Sugarfoot Rag

I got a big jug of cider and a bottle of wine
One's for and honey and the other is mine
Sip on the cider and sip on the wine
Both sip together and a have a good time

One foot, two foot, slew foot, drag
Gonna spend all my money and a git on a Jag
Swing my honey to the Sugarfoot Rag

Walk right up and stomp on the floor
And swing up the middle with a shoe-fly four

[Chorus: x2]"
Jazz,"It's a great day for the Irish, it's a great day for fair!
The sidewalks of New York are thick with blarney

We're feeling so inspirish, shure because for all the Irish

Jazz,"Well, money's gettin' cheaper, prices gettin' steeper 
Found myself a woman but I just couldn't keep her 
Times gettin' tougher than tough 
Things gettin' rougher than rough 
I make a lot of money, I just keep spendin' the stuff 
Well, pork chops on the market, ask the butcher for a pound 
Couldn't buy a pork chop when I laid my money down 
Times gettin' tougher than tough 
Things gettin' rougher than rough 
I make a lot of money, just keep spendin' the stuff 
Well, politicians are tellin' folks to cut out on their meat 
Why don't they cut the price an' let the people eat? 
Times gettin' tougher than tough 
Things gettin' rougher than rough 
I make a lot of money, I just keep spendin' the stuff 
Well, I can't afford to live, I guess I'll have to try 
Undertaker's got a union, and it costs to much to die

Things gettin' rougher than rough 
I make a lot of money, I just keep spendin' the stuff

Jazz,"Oh Lordy Lord, Oh Lordy Lord
It hurts me so bad for us to part
But some day, baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

So many mornings since you've been gone
I've been worried and grieving my life alone
But some day, baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

So many days since you went away
I had to worry both night and day
But some day, baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
No, I ain't gonna worry my life no more

You're on my mind every place I go
How much I love you nobody knows
But some day, baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

So that's my story, that is all I have to say to you
Goodbye baby and I don't care what you do
But some day, baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

Jazz,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Jazz,"Once I had a secret love,
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore."
Jazz,"When on foreign shores I am 
Very truly yours I am 
But if inclined to play I am 
Sweetheart, that's the way I am 

When in Spain for reasons I don't explain 
I remain enjoying a brew 
Don't deplore my fondness for fundador 
You know how a fundador can lead to a few 

And baby when in Rome I do as the Romans do 
If per chance I'm saying farewell to France 
And romance drops in from the blue 
Cherchez l'amour I beg of you please endure 
My taking a brief detour with somebody new 
It's just that when in Rome I do as the Romans do 

And though from Italy I lied to you prettily 
Oh don't think of me bitterly 
But know that I'm true 

Except now and then in Rome 
I get that old yearn in Rome 
And naturally when in Rome 
I do as the Romans do"
Jazz,There were other loves before I found you And I wish sometimes that we had never met For life without you darling can never be the same For having loved you once I can't forget (Forget) I remember all your smiles and laughter (And laughter) I remember love light shining in your eyes And though I only had you for just a little while When you were there the whole world seemed so right (All) I remember these things through bitter tears (All) The touch of your hand in mine (All) And though you're not here through the lonely years With memories of you I'll never be the alone There'll maybe other arms to soothe my sadness There will be other loves that I have never met But life without you darling can never be the same For having loved you once I can't forget you
Jazz,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died"
Jazz,"She gets too hungry, for dinner at eight
She loves the theater, but she never comes late
She never bother, with people she hate
That's why this chick is a tramp

She doesn't like crap games, with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem, in ermines and pearls
Won't dish out dirt, with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp

She likes the free, fresh wind in her hair
Life without care, she's broke, it's old
She hate California, it's crowded and damp
That's why the lady is a tramp

She likes the free, fresh wind in her hair
Life without care, she's broke, it's old
She hate California, it's crowded and damp
That's why the lady is a tramp
That's why the lady is a tramp"
Jazz,"The day is my enemy, the night my friend, For I'm always so alone till the day draws to an end, But when the sun goes down and the moon comes through, To the monotone of the evening's drone I'm all alone with you. All through the night, I delight in your love, All through the night you're so close to me! All through the night, From a height far above, You and your love brings me ecstasy! When dawn comes to waken me, You're never there at all! I know you've forsaken me Till the shadows fall, But then once again I can dream, I've the right To be close to you all through the night."
Jazz,"Sentado na areia da praia de madrugada
Ouvindo o barulho do mar
Venda a dança das ondas
Sentindo o vento me tocar
Eu começo a me perguntar
Por quanto tempo ainda vou andar
E nesse tempo quanto eu vou levar
Pra te encontrar de novo?
Mar...Melhor aqui só com voçê
Mar...Melhor aqui só com você
Ainda...Trago nos meus bolsos
Os meus cigarros os meus nervosos
A tatuagem no meu corpo
E o mar profundo é um consolo
De um quadro perfeito pintado
Por Zeus para Deus
Pra me permitir ficar de frente ao mar
Peço a Deus,aos ateus´
Pra me permitir ficar de frente ao mar
Peço a Zeus aos Judeus
Pra me permitir ficar de frente
Peço a Zeus aos plebeus
Ainda...Traço um esboço
De um vernissage a céu exposto
E as tatuagens do teu corpo
Combinam com as do meu corpo
Num quadro perfeito
Pintado por Zeus para Deus
Pra me permitir ficar de frente ao mar
Peço a zeus,aos ateus
Pra me permitir ficar de frente ao mar
Peço a Deus aos plebeus
Pra me permitir ficar de frente
Peço a deus e aos ateus"
Jazz,"Make me rainbows
Make me spring in the snow
Make me beautiful music wherever I go

Make me unwind, leave behind rhyme or reason
Make me a room where I'll bloom out of season

Make me sunsets, paint our names in the sky
Let your arms be my wings and together we'll fly
Don't let me fall till I'm all I can be

Make me some rainbows
Star-spangled rainbows
Please make those rainbows for me

Make me unwind, leave behind rhyme or reason
Make me a room where I'll bloom out of season

Make me sunsets, paint our names in the sky
Let your arms be my wings and together we'll fly
Don't let me fall till I'm all I can be

Make me some rainbows
Star-spangled rainbows
Please make some rainbows for me

Make those rainbows
Star-spangled rainbows
Please make some rainbows for me

Make some rainbows
Star-spangled rainbows
Please make some rainbows for me"
Jazz,"Strange dear, but true, dear
When I'm close to you, dear
The stars fill the sky
So in love with you am I

Even without you
My arms fold about you
You know, darling, why
So in love with you am I

In love with the night mysterious
The night when you first were there
In love with my joy delirious
When I knew that you could care

So taunt me and hurt me
Deceive me, desert me
I'm yours 'til I die
So in love
So in love
So in love with you, my love, am I"
Jazz,"As you listen to the band don't you get a bubble? 
As you listen to them play don't you get a glow? 
If you step out on the floor
You'll forget your trouble
If you go into your dance
You'll forget your woe
So

Come
Get together
Let the dance floor feel your leather
Step as lightly as a feather
Let yourself go

Come
Hit the timber
Loosen up and start to limber
Can't you hear that hot marimba? 
Let yourself go

Let yourself go
Relax
And let yourself go
Relax
You've got yourself tied up in a knot
The night is cold but the music's hot
So

Come
Cuddle closer
Don't you dare to answer ""no, sir""
Butcher, banker, clerk and grocer
Let yourself go"
Jazz,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me"
Jazz,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon."
Jazz,"Dear old Southland I hear you calling me.
And I long how I long to roam 
back to my old Kentucky home.
Dear old Southland for you my heart is yearning
And I long just to see once more"
Jazz,"Go on and sing my heart
You know it's spring my heart
So why not show it
Pretend you're glad my heart
Although you're sad my heart
He mustn't know it

Remember love is not an easy game
No two hearts ever beat quite the same

Go on and dance my heart
Our only chance my heart is to forget it
Should you despair my heart
He'll know you care my heart
And we'll regret it
It it's to be we soon shall see and
If it's not to be no power on earth
Can make it so

Pretend it's spring my heart
Go on and sing my heart
For if you sing he'll never know"
Jazz,"[Chorus]
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right

You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

When I'm home, everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

[Chorus]

So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

When I'm home, everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

You know I feel all right
You know I feel all right"
Jazz,"Music play 
Something dreamy for dancing 
While we're here romancing 
It's love's holiday 
And Love will be our guide 

Close your Eyes 
When you open them dear 
I'll be right hear by your side 
So...

Close your eyes 
Rest your head on my shoulder and sleep 
Close your eyes 
And I will close mine 

Close your eyes 
Let's pretend that we're both counting sheep 
Close your eyes 
This is divine 

Music play 
Something dreamy for dancing 
While were here romancing 
It's love's holiday 
And Love will be our guide

Close your Eyes 
When you open them dear 
I'll be near by your side 
So won't you close your eyes"
Jazz,"Isn't it romantic? Music in the night, a dream that can be heard Isn't it romantic? Moving shadows write the oldest magic word I hear the breezes playing in the trees above While all the world is saying you were meant for love Isn't it romantic? Merely to be young on such a night as this? Isn't it romantic? Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss Sweet symbols in the moonlight Do you mean that I will fall in love perchance? Isn't it romance? Sweet symbols in the moonlight Do you mean that I will fall in love perchance? Isn't it romantic? Isn't it romance?"
Jazz,"Ooh

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe that God put sun and moon up in the sky.
I don't mind the gray skies
'cause they're just clouds passing by.

Heaven is a goodness time. 
A brighter light on high.

Do unto others as you would have them do to you.

And have a brighter by and by.

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe God is now, was then and always will be.
With God's blessing we can make it through eternity.

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through."
Jazz,"You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothings wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!

Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap

You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap

Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
Shell hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map

You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap

Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
Shell hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map

And then you wonder how it all came about
Its too late now there's no gettin' out
You fell in love, and love is the tender trap"
Jazz,"Once was a kingdom, far far away.
Love was the rule of the day.
Nothing more nothing less
Than to give your friend your best.
There's much more story that I could tell
To make the hardest hearts swell.

This is the story when love was king.

When love was king, do you remember?
When love was king, when love was king
I remember when love was king

He ruled the land, with his fist unfurled
With open arms for the world
Of hungry children, first he'd think
To pull their lives from the brink
When love was king
He rescued souls lost in the sea
In drifting vessel he would hear their plea
When love was king
He threw a line before they'd sink
And gave the thirsty ones a drink

He told the meek that they should try
To use the sword to smite the lie
That being king is for the weak
When love was king
I pray the lord these words we seek

When love was king
He showed respect for every man
Regardless of their skin or clan
Beside him stood his mighty queen
and equal force wise and keen
He lifted up the underneath
And all his wealth he did bequeath
To those who toiled with out a gain
SO they would remember his reign

So seek someplace to call your own
Right next to this mighty shinning throne
When love was king
When love was king"
Jazz,"Chillun', listen here to me
This is my philosophy
To see me through the day
To scare my cares away

All God's Chillun Got Rhythm
All God's Chillun got swing
Maybe haven't got money
Maybe haven't got shoes
All God's Chillun Got Rhythm
For to push away the blues
Yeah !

All God's Chillun got trouble
Trouble don't mean a thing
When they start to go ho ho ho de ho
Troubles bound to go 'way, say!

All God's Chillun Got Swing.

Do I feel higher than a kite can fly!
Give me lovin', baby, I feel high.
"
Jazz,"What is different, what is news
We're on a carousel spinning through deja-vu
What remains and for what reason
We see pastures change but to familiar seasons

All over again, all over again
We're stuck in a pattern, an endless refrain
All over again, all over again
We're trap in a loop on a fast moving train

How many songs, how many poems
'Til we turn away from illusionary omens
How many spins, how many springs
Before common sense finally wins

All over again, all over again
We're stuck in a pattern, an endless refrain
All over again, all over again
We're trap in a loop on a fast moving train

All over again, all over again
We're stuck in a pattern, an endless refrain
All over again, all over again
We're trap in a loop on a fast moving train

All over again, all over again
We're stuck in a pattern, an endless refrain
All over again, all over again
We're trap in a loop on a fast moving train"
Jazz,"Summer is the season
When for no good reason love pays you a call
You become a lover only to discover summer caused it all
But what can you do, it's not up to you
For love is in the air beside a summer sea

There's a big affair awaiting you and me
Something in the weather caused you every heart
Time to get together with a new love swearing true love

Ripples hug the shore and kiss the burning sand
Nature is imploring you to take a hand
So if you are fancy free, this is where you ought to be
For love is in the air beside a summer sea

Ripples hug the shore and kiss the burning sand
Nature is imploring you to take a hand
So if you are fancy free, this is where you ought to be
For love is in the air, love is in the air
Love is in the air beside a summer sea"
Jazz,"Never know how much I love you, 
Never know how much I care.
When you put your arms around me, 
I get a fever that's so hard to bear.

You give me fever, 
When you kiss me, 
Fever when you hold me tight.
Fever! In the morning, 
Fever all through the night.

Sun lights up the daytime
And moon lights up the night... 
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever
When you kiss me, 
Fever when you hold me tight.
Fever! In the morning, 
And fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Romeo loved Juliette
Juliette she felt the same
When he put his arms around her he said, 
""Julie, Baby, you're my flame

""Thou giveth fever
""When we kisseth
""Fever with thy flaming youth
""Fever! I'm afire, 
""Fever, yeah, I burn, forsooth.""

Cap'in Smith and Pocahontas had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said, 
""Daddy, oh, don't you dare! 

""He gives me fever
""With his kisses
""Fever when he holds me tight
""Fever! I'm his misses, So
""Daddy, Won't you treat him right?""

Now you've listened to my story, 
Here's the point that I have made:
Chicks were born to give you fever, 
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade

They give you fever
When you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever! 'till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn"
Jazz,"Hello Ma! I done it again
I got the funniest yen
And before I knew it
I was in somebody's arms

Y'know, ma, how gentlemen are
He took me out in his car
And before I knew it
We were surrounded by farms

Then we spoke of the drought
And we chatted about his old uncle Ben
Then he asked for a kiss
And I gave him a kiss and then, then

Hello Ma! I done it again
I got the funniest yen
And before I knew it my heart said do it
And I fell in love again"
Jazz,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street"
Jazz,"Don't you know I'd work for you, I'd slave for you
Be a beggar or a knave for you?
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along 

Gladly move the earth for you
Prove my love, dear, and it's worth it for you
If that isn't love, it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along 

With all the words, dear, at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you, baby, come what may
My heart is yours--what more can I say?

I would cry for you, even sigh for you
Tear those stars down from the sky for you
If that isn't love, it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along 

Walk on burning coals for you
I would drive the Chrysler, leave the Rolls for you
If that ain't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along 

I would try to hit high C for you
I'd even punch out Mr. T for you
If that ain't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along 

There's not a thing that you can't ask of me
Go on, demand any task of me
If you want the moon or a lavaliere
All you got to do is nibble on my ear

I would rob, steal, beg, borrow, and lie for you
Lay my little body down and die for you
(If that ain't love, if that isn't love)
If that ain't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along"
Jazz,"The day is my enemy, the night my friend
For I'm always so alone
'Till the day draws to an end
But when the sun goes down
And the moon comes through
To the monotone of the evening's drone
I'm all alone with you

All through the night
I delight in your love
All through the night
You're so close to me
All through the night
From a height far above
You and your love brings me ecstasy

When dawn comes to waken me
You're never there at all
I know you've forsaken me
'Till the shadows fall
But then once again
I can dream
I've the right
To be close to you
All through the night"
Jazz,"Only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so new
And time after time
I tell myself that
I'm so lucky to be loving you"
Jazz,"Come a rain storm put your rubbers on your feet,
Comes a snow storm you can get a little heat;
Comes love nothing can be done.
Comes a fire then you know just what to do,
Blow a tire You can buy another shoe,
Comes love nothing can be done.
Don't try hidin' 'cause there isn't any use,
You'll start slidin' when your heart turns on the juice.
Comes a headache you can lose it in a day,
Comes a toothache see the dentist right away;
Comes love nothing can be done!

Comes a heat wave you can hurry to the shore,
Comes a summons you can hide behind the door;
Comes love Nothing can be done.
Comes the measles you can quarantine the room,
Comes a mousie you can chase it with a broom;
Comes love nothing can be done.
That's all brother, If you've ever been in love,
That's all brother, you know what I'm speaking of!
Comes a nightmare you can always stay awake,
Comes depression you may get another break;
Comes love nothing can be done!"
Jazz,"Jim doesn't ever bring me pretty flowers
Jim never tries to cheer my lonely hours
Don't know why I'm so crazy for Jim

Jim never tells me I'm his heart's desire
I never seem to set his love afire
Gone are the years I've wasted on him
Sometimes when I get feelin' low
I say let's call it quits
Then I hang on and let him go 
Breakin' my heart in bits

Someday I know that Jim will up and leave me
But even if he does you can believe me
I'll go on carrying the torch for Jim

I'll go on lovin' my Jim"
Jazz,"Thinking of you
I walk alone
Don't follow me down
Underground

But you think you're falling, I've been there before
I am the ocean but you are the shore
I'll keep on walking, of this I am sure

But if I could see it through
I'd give it all to you
Carry the heart we grew
Remembering Waterloo
With you

Dreaming of you
I wake alone
Won't try to reach out
And lie to you

I could be the siren, pull you from the shore
'Cause I know you find out I've been there before
But I'll keep on going, of this I am sure

If I could see it through
I'd give it all to you
Carry the heart we grew
Remembering Waterloo
With you

Oh oh oh oh
Dreaming of you
Thinking of you
Walking alone
Dreaming of you
Thinking of you
I stand here alone

But if I could see it through (if I could see it through)
I'd give it all to you (I would give it all to you)
Carry the heart we grew (carry the heart we grew)
Remembering Waterloo
With you"
Jazz,"(Auf wiedersehen, auf wiedersehen)
(We'll meet again, sweetheart)
This lovely day has flown away
The time has come to part

We'll kiss again, like this again
Don't let the teardrops start
With love that's true, I'll wait for you
Auf wiedersehen, sweetheart

Auf wiedersehen, auf wiedersehen
We'll meet again, sweetheart
This lovely day has flown away
The time has come to part

We'll kiss again, like this again
Don't let the teardrops start
With love that's true, I'll wait for you
Auf wiedersehen, sweetheart"
Jazz,"Easy come, easy go, that's the way,
If love must have it's day, then
As it came, let it go.

No, no remorse, no regrets
We should part exactly as we met
Just easy come, easy go.

We never dreamt of romantic dangers
But now that it ends, let's be friends
And not two strangers

Easy come, easy go, here we are,
So darling au revoir
It's easy come, easy go."
Jazz,"Hey have you ever tried,
Really reaching out for the other side?
I may be climbing on rainbows
But, baby here goes.

Dreams they're for those who sleep,
Life is for us to keep,
And if you're wond'ring
What this song is leading to

I want to make it with you
I really think that we can make it boy.

No, you don't know me well,
In ev'ry little thing only time will tell,
If you believe the things that I do.
And we'll see it through.

Life can be short or long,
Love can be right or wrong,
And if I choose the one
I'd like to help me through,

I'd like to make it with you
I really think that we can make it boy.

Baby you know that
Dreams they're for those who sleep,
Life is for us to keep
And if I choose the one
I'd like to help me through,

I'd like to make it with you
I really think that we can make it boy."
Jazz,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad;
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know."
Jazz,"I know why I've waited, know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone exactly like you
Why should we spend money on a show or two?
No one does those love scenes exactly like you

You make me feel so grand, I wanna hand the world to you
You seem to understand each foolish
Little scheme I'm scheming, dream I'm dreaming
Now I know why mother taught me to be true
She meant me for someone exactly like you

You make me feel so grand, I wanna hand the world to you
You seem to understand each foolish
Little scheme that I'm scheming, dream I'm dreaming
Now I know why mother taught me to be true
She meant me for someone exactly like you
Someone exactly like you"
Jazz,"I've had a mighty busy day
I've had to pack my things away
Now I'm going to give the landlord back his key
The very key
That opened up my dreary flat
Where many weary nights I sat
Thinking of the folks down home who think of me
You can bet you'll find me singing happily

[chorus:]
When the midnight choo-choo leaves for Alabam'
I'll be right there
I've got my fare
When I see that rusty-haired conductor-man
I'll grab him by the collar 
And I'll holler
""Alabam'! Alabam'!""
That's where you stop your train
That brings me back again
Down home where I'll remain
Where my honey-lamb am
I will be right there with bells
When that old conductor yells
""All aboard! All aboard!
All aboard for Alabam'""

[2nd verse:]
The minute that I reach the place
I'm goin' to overfeed my face
'Cause I haven't had a good meal since the day 
I went away
I'm goin' to kiss my Pa and Ma
A dozen times for ev'ry star
Shining over Alabama's new mown hay
I'll be glad enough to throw myself away "
Jazz,"A Portrait of Jennie
More precious to me
Than a masterpiece how ever famous it be

The portrait of Jennie
Is etched on my heart
Where her features have been sketched from the start

Ah, the color and beatuy of life 
And the glow of her sprit divine
All cast in heaven's own design

With a portrait of Jennie
I never will part
For there isn't any portrait of Jennie
Except in my heart

For there isn't any portrait of Jennie
Except in my heart"
Jazz,"Darn that dream, I dream each night
You say you love me and you hold me tight
But when I awake, you're out of sight
Darn that dream

Darn your lips and darn your eyes
They lift me high above the moonlit skies
Then I tumble out of paradise
Oh, darn that dream

Darn that crazy one track, mind of mine
It can't understand that you don't care
Just to change the mood I'm in
I'd welcome a nice old nightmare

Darn that dream and bless it too
Without that dream, I never would have you
But it haunts me and it won't come true
Darn that dream

Darn that dream and bless it too
Without that dream, I never would have you
But it haunts me and it won't come true"
Jazz,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said, ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions, but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream"
Jazz,"I often wonder why he came to me
Brought such a flame to me

And let it die
And if another love should find my heart
It will remind my heart of your goodbye

With every new love you
Will come back to me
In others eyes, its you I see
If I love again
Though its someone new

If I love again
It'll still be you
In someone else's firm embrace
I'll close my eyes but see your face

If I love again
I'll find other charms
But I'll make believe, you are in my arms
And though my lips whisper

""I love you""
My heart will not be true
I'll be loving
Every time I love again"
Jazz,"Let there be you, 
Let there be me. 
Let there be oysters 
Under the sea.

Let there be wind, 
An occasional rain. 
Chile con carne, 
Sparkling champagne 

Let there be birds 
To sing in the trees, 
Someone to bless me 
Whenever I sneeze. 

Let there be cuckoos, 
A lark and a dove, 
But first of all, please 
Let there be love. 

Let there be cuckoos, 
A lark and a dove, 
But first of all, please  
Let there be love

Love 
Love 

Let there be love."
Jazz,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon"
Jazz,"Ain't got the change of a nickel
Ain't got no bounce in my shoes
Ain't got no fancy to tickle

I ain't got nothing but the blues
Ain't got no coffee that's perking
Ain't got no winnings to lose

Ain't got a dream that is working
I ain't got nothing but the blues
When trumpets flare up

I keep my hair up
I just can't make it come down
Believe me, peppie
I can't get happy

Since my ever-loving baby left town
Ain't got no rest in my slumbers
Ain't got no feelings to bruise
Ain't got no telephone numbers
I ain't got nothing but the blues"
Jazz,"The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play
Through a meadowland toward a closing door
A door marked ""nevermore"" that wasn't there before

The lonely night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you

(The lonely night discloses) just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you"
Jazz,"Walked with no one and talked with no one

Jazz,Yeah I remember you Of course I do How could I ever forget? Look at you So you don't do to impress So you don't do stress Then you copy tested Right All that attention Don't need to mention Plenty to pick from And I see how you rocking There is just no stopping And you make head spin yeah And it's not that you're trying You're just up flying I have to upload you Cause you do what you do You got nothing to prove But everybody's watching From your walk in the room You light up the room And the eagle eyes zoom in They're trying to capture you With their power But you are so immune You smile at me I smile at you I'll see you soon [Chorus] You're making me wait Making me wait Making me wait Making me work overtime for you baby And I fall for you And I fall for you See everybody wants you Everybody loves you Who's gonna free you? Me I can see that is tiring Your Or maybe retiring I can feel that you're over They just don't know it yet What you're gonna do babe You can leave out on the back door That's why is here for Meet you with my face I might jump in the gun Are you really having fun See you .. your eyes There is no need for lies See baby I got your I'm your guardian angel I just wanna help you You take my hand I touch your heart I just wanna heal you [Chorus] I can give you a rub down While you give me the run down Of all you have been through Cause you are you baby It will make you feel better Just being together We've done this forever I'll help you remember baby [Chorus]
Jazz,"Whenever it's early twilight
I watch till a star breaks through
Funny, it's not a star I see
It's always you

Whenever I roam through roses
And lately I often do
Funny, it's not a rose I touch
It's always you

If a breeze, caresses me
It's really you strolling by
If I hear a melody
It's merely the way you sigh

Wherever you are, you're near me
You dare me to be untrue
Funny, each time I fall in love
It's always you

"
Jazz,"I keep hearin' you're concerned about my happiness
But all that thought you're givin' me is conscience I guess
If I was walkin' in your shoes, I wouldn't worry none
While you 'n' your friends are worried about me I'm havin' lots of fun

[Chorus]
Countin' flowers on the wall
That don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire till dawn with a deck of fifty-one
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me I've nothin' to do

Last night I dressed in tails, pretended I was on the town
As long as I can dream it's hard to slow this swinger down
So please don't give a thought to me, I'm really doin' fine
You can always find me here, I'm havin' quite a time

[Chorus]

It's good to see you, I must go, I know I look a fright
Anyway my eyes are not accustomed to this light
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete
So I must go back to my room and make my day complete

[Chorus]

Don't tell me I've nothin' to do"
Jazz,"I've been around the world in a plane
Settled revolutions in Spain
The North Pole I have charted
But can't get started with you
And at the golf course I'm under par
Metro-Goldwyn wants me to star
I've got a house and a show place
But can't get no place with you

You're so supreme
The lyrics I write of you
Dream, dream, day and night of you
Scheme just for the sight of you
Baby but what good does it do?
I've been consulted by Franklin D.
Robert Taylor has had me to tea
But now I'm broken-hearted
Can't get started with you

When first we met, how you elated me
Pet, you devastated me
Yet, now you've deflated me
'Till, you're my Waterloo
When J.P. Morgan bows I just nod
Green Pastures wanted me to play God
The Siamese Twins I've parted
Can't get started with you"
Jazz,"There's an infinity of ways
And just as many people striving for them, oh
Who's to say what is wrong or right
Only we can judge what lies within us
It's our code of life

So much is counting on what we say
So many virtues that we must weigh
Where's the light we long for
love must find a way
And all things in their time will follow, oh....

It's like a wave of honor in motion, 
floating away,
It's like an overwhelming emotion,
one and the same
If we take the time to find it
We can help define a way
uncharted

Code of ethics, feel it
Stand, be counted
Life is only what we make it
So don't fake it
Just make it right

Like a visionary's dream
There's a cry for truth we need to know
Is it life or a novel's theme
Underlying codes we'd live or die for
It's a mystery

Violence is growing, it's in the air
People are starving while others stare
Where's the light we long for?

Love must find a way
And all things in their time will follow - oh
If we take the time to find it
We can help define a way
uncharted

Code of ethics, feel it
Stand, be counted
Life is only what we make it
So don't fake it
Just make it right

Code of ethics, live it
Stand, be counted
Life is only what we make it
So don't fake it
Just make it right"

Jazz,"When the sun comes out
And that rain stops beatin' on my window pane
When the sun comes out
There'll be bluebirds 'round my door, singin' like they did before

That ol' storm broke out
And my man, gal walked off and left me in the rain
Though he's, gone I doubt
If he'll, stay away for good, I'd stop livin' if he should

Love is funny, it's not always peaches, cream and honey
Just when everything looked bright and sunny
Suddenly the cyclone came, I'll never be the same

Til that sun comes out
And the rain stops beatin' on my window pane
If my heart holds out
Let it rain and let it pour, it may not be long before
There's a knockin' at my door
Then you'll know the one I love walked in
When the sun comes out"
Jazz,"Falling in love with love is falling for make-believe
Falling in love with love is playing the fool
Caring too much is such a juvenile fancy
Learning to trust is just for children in school

I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes unable to see
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting
But love fell out with me

Oh, I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes unable to see
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting
But love fell out with me"
Jazz,"There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,
There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,
The corn is as high as an elephants eye,
An' it looks like it's climbing clear up in the sky.

Oh, what a beautiful mornin',
Oh, what a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way.

All the cattle are standin' like statues,
All the cattle are standin' like statues,
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by,
But a little brown mav'rick is winkin' her eye.

Oh, what a beautiful mornin',
Oh, what a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way.

All the sounds of the earth are like music
All the sounds of the earth are like music
The breeze is so busy it don't miss a tree
And an old weepin' willer is laughin' at me

Oh, what a beautiful mornin',
Oh, what a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way."
Jazz,"Marie, Marie, Marie

Marie, the dawn is breaking
Marie, (ooh, Marie) you'll soon be waking
To find you heart is aching
And tears (and tears) will fall (will fall) as you recall
The moon in all its splendor
A kiss (ooh, a kiss) so very tender
The words, ""Will you surrender
To me, (Marie), Marie, (Marie-ee)?""

Everybody look what's going down 

There's battle lines being drawn 
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong 
Young people speaking their minds 
Getting so much resistance from behind 

It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 

What a field-day for the heat 
A thousand people in the street 
Singing songs and carrying signs 
Mostly say, hooray for our side 

It's s time we stop, hey, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 

Paranoia strikes deep 
Into your life it will creep 
It starts when you're always afraid 
You step out of line, the man come and take you away 

We better stop, hey, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 
Stop, hey, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 
Stop, now, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 
Stop, children, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down"
Jazz,"To you my heart cries out, Perfidia, 
For I found you, the love of my life, in somebody else's arms 
Your eyes are echoing perfidia, 
Forgetful of our promise of love, you're sharing another's charms

With a sad lament my dreams have faded like a broken melody 
While the gods of love look down and laugh at what romantic fools we mortals be
And now I know my love was not for you 
And so I take it back with a sigh, perfidious one, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye"
Jazz,"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me then I don't care

Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love so how are they to know
When we met I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in"
Jazz,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence"
Jazz,"We kiss in a shadow,
We hide from the moon,
Our meetings are few,
And over too soon.

We speak in a whisper,
Afraid to be heard;
When people are near,
We speak not a word.
Alone in our secret,
Together we sigh,
For one smiling day to be free
To kiss in the sunlight
And say to the sky:
""Behold and believe what you see!
Behold how my lover loves me!""

We speak in a whisper,
Afraid to be heard;
When people are near,

We speak not a word.
Alone in our secret,
Together we sigh,
For one smiling day to be free

To kiss in the sunlight
And say to the sky:
""Behold and believe what you see!
Behold how my lover loves me!""

To kiss in the sunlight
And say to the sky:
""Behold and believe what you see!
Behold how my lover loves me!"""
Jazz,"Five star general spit, hush them niggas
I star, why even discuss them niggas?
By far, I'm the shit, flush them niggas
Fuck them niggas, I'm a crush them niggas

Chrome heater, street sweeper
Gun shots get deeper, cough up a lung and a liter
Twelve shot Nine now, one of my new pets
And when these twins squeeze it sounds like duets

Nigga burn, yeah, my Fam learn to earn
We got shit locked with no key holes to turn
Platinum Navigator, easy when you earn a buck
It's like a big fuckin' beeper when you turn it up

Shit vibratin'
Hoes titties bouncin', rubbin' all on my shit, bitch try waitin'
Straight to the telly huh, Sauce got angles to hit
Billboards triangles and shit

And who's Jeter? The Don Juan for you Don Con's
In the double Nine Yukon, tote two arms
From Brooknam 'til death do
And I bet you when I spit shots they connect to dead you

Lil' monkeys postin' for wreck
They get trapped up and extorted for your toast and your vest
I'm no joke, so laugh and be laughin' to death
And if you think it's so simple, you'll be gassed and then left

It's the game tight nigga, chain two below
I'm a Gigolo Mommy, the fame I ain't fo'
The foes I don't hate, hoes I don't chase
Henny I drink straight, my money is big faced

For you small change niggas who playin' to ball
I got six digits now, what you playin' it for?
I'm the youngest out of Marcy and the shit don't stop
Steppin' up to the top 'bout to have shit locked.

You want hits? We got hits
Nothin' but the hot hits, once it drop
Everybody's topless
(Sunstroke)

Hennessey shots and fly bitches
(Gun smoke)
The enemies plot on my riches

You want hits? We got hits
Nothin' but the hot hits, once it drop
Everybody's topless
(Sunstroke)

Hennessey shots and fly bitches
(Gun smoke)
The enemies plot on my riches

My automatic stoutest be off balance
Gun with the silence
Outta state, mad mileage
Your crew wild but we the wildest

Switch my trigger finger often to prevent a callus
For me many Men hold malice, I react with violence
Since we tryin' to double the dough, we double the sins
Even the gnats is double now lookin' like fraternal twins

The rap killings be serial
The FEDS tried to link Da Rainjahz to the crime
Through the use of genetic material
I'm takin' all bets, who want it?

Wise, hard to touch, weavin' shit like Prince Naseem Hamed
The flow is Ten karat and your lyrics is poor
Big horse, plus you walk like your salads been tossed
Smoke the explosion, rock second hand gold that's stolen

Straight haul off and smack a nigga just for posin'
Bleed Hennessey, rhyme like there's Ten of me
So you remember me?
Every verse, I'm on should be considered a felony

Why the fuck niggas be hatin'? I don't even know
Niggas need to go ahead with them outdated flows
Da Rainjahz 'cause precipitation, and we rain in this bitch like
Hurricane Mitch

Fuck the fame, son, I'm in it for the dough and another whip
Ghetto cracked out on some other shit
Style switch, leave the whole city dark like the Mothership
Y'all know the half, I hold the Nine with the rubber grip

Seen less, y'all re-imported by the government
If I wasn't rappin' I'd be on the corners bubblin'
Doublin' my cream on a triple beam
Instead I keep the team tight and feel like ain't shit gon' divide us

Not even riches, not even bitches
Look now, niggas of the World stay paintin' pictures
Of the inner-city realness
Who can relate? roll and fat one and feel this
We put it down

You want hits? We got hits
Nothin' but the hot hits, once it drop
Everybody's topless
(Sunstroke)

Hennessey shots and fly bitches
(Gun smoke)
The enemies plot on my riches"
Jazz,"Because you're mine the brightest star I see looks down
My love, and envies me because you're mine
Because you're mine because you're mine
The breeze that hurries by becomes a melody
And why, because you're mine, because you're mine
I only know for as long as I may live
I'll only live for the kiss that you alone may give me
And when we kiss that isn't thunder dear
It's only my poor heart you hear, and it's applause
Because you're mine! because you're mine!
 
Because you're mine the brightest star I see looks down
My love, and envies me because you're mine
Because you're mine because you're mine
The breeze that hurries by becomes a melody
And why, because you're mine, because you're mine
I only know for as long as I may live
I'll only live for the kiss that you alone may give me
And when we kiss that isn't thunder dear
It's only my poor heart you hear, and it's applause

Jazz,"Oh, show me the way to the next whiskey bar.
Oh, don't ask why. Oh, don't ask why.
'Cause I must find the next whiskey bar.
If I don't find the next whiskey bar,
I tell you I will die, I tell you I will die.
I tell you, I tell you, I tell you I will die.

Oh, moon of Alabama, so high up in the sky.
I lost him, I lost my lover.
I need a drink. Can you guess why?

Oh, moon of Alabama, so high up in the sky.
I lost him, I lost my lover.
I need a drink, and you know why.
I bet you know why. I bet you know why"
Jazz,"Tonight you're mine completely
You give you love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic of your sighs
Will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow

So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow"
Jazz,"Life has a crazy pattern
And fortune comes to few
I'd like to take the pattern
And fashion it for you

Though there may be lean while
Darling, in the meanwhile

I'll give you my love
I'm sure that love will see us through
Baby, baby, what else can I do?
If you want the moon
I'll bring the moon right down to you
Baby, baby, what else can I do?

Some day we'll live in a mansion
Out where the pastures are green
But even in a small room
Just a little hall room
You'll be the king
I'll be the queen

So, please, take my heart
Just for a start till dreams come true
Baby, baby, what else can I do?

Jazz,"April in paris, chestnuts in blossom
Holiday tables under the trees
April in paris, this is a feeling
That no one can ever reprise
I never knew the charm of spring
I never met it face to face
I never new my heart could sing
I never missed a warm embrace
Till april in paris
Whom can I run to
What have you done to my heart
"

and on every street corner you hear
silver bells

it's christmas time in the city
ring-a-ling
hear them ring
soon it will be christmas day
strings of street lights

as the shoppers rush home with their treasures
hear the snow crunch
see the kids bunch this is santa's big scene
and above all the bustle you hear
silver bells

Jazz,"I can only give you love that lasts forever
And the promise to be near each time you call
And the only heart I own for you and you alone
That's all, that's all

I can only give you country walks in springtime
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall
And a love whose burning light
Will warm the winter night
That's all, that's all

There are those, I am sure, who have told you
They would give you the world for a toy
All I have are these arms to enfold you
And the love time can never destroy

If you're wondering what I'm asking in return, dear
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small
Say it's me that you adore, for now and evermore
That's all, that's all

Jazz,"Down on the Mississippi River in a knockdo dive
I met a trumpet playin' character and man alive
When he began to rip, he really played it from the hip
And when I asked about his name, they told me, that's The Lip
(Yip yip yip yip)
No one plays high notes like The Lip

He's got a tone that's reminiscent of a boy named Bix
He plays so high that only dogs can hear him, just for kicks
And when I asked him does he read
He says, I'll tell you, hon'
I read a little bit but not enough to hurt me none
(Yip yip yip yip)
No one plays high notes like The Lip

I said The Lip
(She must mean Ray Anthony, huh)
I said The Lip
(No, man, she means Harry James)
I said The Lip
(You mean Louis Prima)
I said The Lip
(Noo, Lip er ace)
(Yip yip yip yip)
No one plays high notes like The Lip

I never heard a trumpet player play a note so high
I had to coax a lot before The Lip would tell me why
Then he took out a little jar that's labelled high note grease
And he rubs a little every night on his mouthpiece
(Yip yip yip yip)
No one plays high notes like The Lip

Listen here gal, are you kiddin' about all that high note grease?
No, man, I swear, he had ten in a big valise
Wha', you mean he goes to the drugstore
And gets them from the medicine shelf?
No, some cat's told me he makes it himself
(Yip yip yip yip)
Tell us the secret of The Lip

Well, you take a bucketful of steam
And a dozen rooster eggs
And you mix 'em up gently with a bushel full of goldfish legs
And ya hang 'em on a sky hook in the midnight sun
Mmm and then you fry them until they're done
(Yip yip yip yip)
That's the secret of The Lip"
Jazz,"Hey Laura it's me 
Sorry but I had to rang your doorbell so late
But there's something bothering me
I really am sorry but it just couldn't wait
Is there someone else instead of me 
Go ahead and lie to me and I will believe
You're not in love with him and this fool can see
That the rivers of your love flow uphill to me

Hey Laura it's me 
Sorry but I had to ring your doorbell so late
But there's something bothering me
I really am sorry but it just couldn't wait
With a healthy dose of make-believe
Won't you lie to me and make me believe
That you're in love with me and this fool can see
That the rivers of your love flow uphill to me

Hey Laura it's me
Sorry but I had to ring your doorbell so late
But there's something bothering me
All night long I just couldn't wait
With a healthy dose of make-believe
Go ahead and lie to me and make me believe
That you're in love with me oh this foul can see
That the rivers of your love flow uphill to me

Hey Laura it's me
Hey Laura it's me
Hey Laura it's me"
Jazz,"The joy of children laughing
These are the makings

12 it's like this Little Brother, Pete Rock
Another sure shot, another banger
'Soul Survivor, Part II' for me and you, let's get it

I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya, baby
I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya, baby

Yo, master of ceremony, controlled territory
It's Tay, the mad journalist always trying to write a better story
And laying tracks 'cause it's better for me
Calm but predatory, sun niggaz even when the weathers stormy

My crew is down to do whatever for me
Got my back like scoliosis when I'm handling mine
Find it hard, though to manage my time
Between the gaming and rhymes, without severing my family ties

But yo, that's what happens when the world is loving you
Groupies skipping pills with ill plans of fucking you
A high price for fame that's non-refundable
All in the hopes of one day coming out with a double you

I know it sound crazy, right?
Even though it's hard sometimes I still got to stay in the mix
It's Pete Rock on the snare drums and laying the kicks
And on the real I wouldn't trade it for shit
Let's get it up right now, come on

I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya, baby
I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya, baby

I got the magna rocks still heating up the spot
P.R. and L.B. got that shit for blocks
Hip hop when we walk, hip hop when we talk
You can hear it our slang and see the New York

We bought back 94 when the music was pure
Everybody made jams 93' and before
Hearing 'Illmatic' first on the trip to the store
Lost my mind but I knew it was
That we had to work toward forward

On we move now, my life is the roof
Putting the pen to the pad when it's time to spread news
Daily digesting some more wack shit
Mother-fuckers better stick to the script
We need you back Jay

y'all dudes know now we not for play
You want it funky, come around my way
(For Real)
You can choose to rock or choose to roll
I chose Pete 'cause he got the soul
Yeah, let's get it going y'all

I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya, baby
I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya, baby

King cobra rapper crew
Ill Capitan, never roll a foot solider
We push over, you pushovers
Lil' pussies need to douche over

Mass and Gills, Scott hare will make em' gush over
Pussy and poetry, two things that's good for ya
We rock hard just like the hood told us
That fake shit I never could show you
We ought to keep it true and authentic

In they videos trying to walk wit it
L.B. put the street talk in it
From right now till the day that we forfeit it
Just making sure that y'all get it in time to put my heart in it
Little Brother crushing all gimmicks, like what

I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya, baby
I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya, baby

I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya, baby
I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya, baby"
Jazz,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!"
Jazz,"More than you know, more than you know
Man of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find, you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Man of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so, so
More than you'll ever know

Loving you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Loving may be all you can give
But baby, I can't live without it

Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd sigh
If you grew tired and said goodbye
More than I'd show
More than you'll ever know

Loving you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Loving may be all you can give
But baby, I can't live without it

Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd sigh
If you grew tired and said goodbye
More than I'd show
More than you'll ever know

I love you, darling
More than you will ever know"
Jazz,"I have often walked down this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once am I several stories high
Knowing I'm on the street where you live

Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour out of every door?
No, it's just on the street where you live

And oh, the towering feeling just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling that any second you may suddenly appear

People stop and stare, they don't bother me
For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be
Let the time go by, I won't care if I
Can be here on the street where you live"
Jazz,"It was written in the stars 
That our love would be born 
It was written in the stars 
We'd meet early one morn? 

So when first I saw you appear 
As the night left the sea 
This was no coincidence, dear, 
It was fated to be... 

In the heavens high above 
Where dreams flourish and flower 
It was written that our love 
Would grow stronger each hour 

So remember when at last you are mine 
And Venus is mated to Mars 
It was written, 
Always written 
In the stars!"
Jazz,"I heard you cried last night and I know why
I heard you cried last night and so did I

Why did you make us part
I'm so alone, why did you take my heart
You didn't want it for your own

And if you hadn't cared to make amends
I might have never dared, we'd be just friends,
So calm your fears and dry your tears

Come kiss the boy you adore
Now you can smile tonight and cry no more."
Jazz,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me"
Jazz,"Every time it rains
It rains pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven
You'll find your fortune
Fallin' all over town
Be sure that your umbrella is upside down
Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love
You must have showers
So when you hear it thunder
Don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven
For you and me

Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love
You must have showers
So when you hear it thunder
Don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven
For you and me"
Jazz,"Blues with a feelin',
that's what I have today
Blues with a feelin',
that's what I have today
I'm gonna find my baby,
if it takes all night and day
What a lonesome feelin',
when your by yourself
What a lonesome feelin',
when your by yourself
When the one that you're lovin',
have gone away livin'
Girl you know I love you baby,
I wanted the reason why
You only left me baby,
then you left me here to cry
Blues with a feelin',
that's what I have today
I'm gonna find my baby,
if it takes all night and day

"
Jazz,"Yeah we love one another
One blood for all
One blood for the face of the earth
One time ? in life
These are the feelings you have ?
God is majesty
Open your ears and open your heart
And listen to these words from the universe ?
God is the respecter of no one
Giver of all

Treasures of righteousness and love"
Jazz,"i'm sorry darling but
i was miles away from here
but don't worry - i'm with you
'cause nowhere else i would rather be
couldn't live without you
wouldn't do without you near me
i'm so happy where i am
but too much of a good thing
never hurt anybody
so let's leave this noisy town
and move out to tread on enchanted ground
i've got to get things ready
don't delay it any longer
and find a little house in a valley
where the sun's always smiling
a perfect place for you and me
miles away now you see the reason
why i'm drifting miles away
just imagine a great big world
only waiting for us to discover it
i'm getting so impatient
our life could be even better
in our little house in a valley
where the sun's always smiling
where we got some more space to breathe
miles away
when the world gets too much
we'll hide
so no one can find us there
(says answering machine
""phone again
leave your name
don't disturb
our little home miles away."")
let's find a little house in a valley
where the sun's always smiling
my neighbors are jeff and jill
miles away - somewhere miles away"
Jazz,"Without a song the day would never end
Without a song the road would never bend
When things go wrong, a man ain't got a friend
Without a song

That field of corn would never see a plow
That field of corn would be deserted now
A man is born but he's no good no-how
Without a song

I got my troubles and woe but sure as I know that Jordan will roll
I'll get along as long as a song is strong in my soul
I'll never know what makes the rain to fall
I'll never know what makes the grass so tall
I only know there ain't no love at all
Without a song!!"
Jazz,"Will this be moon love, nothing but moon love,
Will you be gone when the dawn comes stealing through?
Are these just moon dreams, grand while the moon beams?
But when the moon fades away, will my dreams come true?
Much as I love you, don't let me love you.
If I must pay for your kiss with lonely tears, say it's not moon love.
Tell me it's true, say you'll be mine when the moon disappears."
Jazz,"Well you gassed her up
Behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one
In your oldsmobile
Barrelin' down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of saturday night

And you got paid on friday
And your pockets are jinglin'
And you see the lights
You get all tinglin' cause you're cruisin' with a 6
And you're looking for the heart of saturday night

Then you comb your hair
Shave your face
Tryin' to wipe out ev'ry trace
All the other days
In the week you know that this'll be the saturday
You're reachin' your peak

Stoppin' on the red
You're goin' on the green
'cause tonight'll be like nothin'
You've ever seen
And you're barrelin' down the boulevard
Lookin' for the heart of saturday night

Tell me is the crack of the poolballs, neon buzzin? 
Telephone's ringin'; it's your second cousin
Is it the barmaid that's smilin' from the corner of her eye? 
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye.

Makes it kind of quiver down in the core
'cause you're dreamin' of them saturdays that came before
And now you're stumblin'
You're stumblin' onto the heart of saturday night

Well you gassed her up
And you're behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one
In your oldsmobile
Barrellin' down the boulevard,
You're lookin' for the heart of saturday night

Is the crack of the poolballs, neon buzzin? 
Telephone's ringin'; it's your second cousin
And the barmaid is smilin' from the corner of her eye
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye.

Makes it kind of special down in the core
And you're dreamin' of them saturdays that came before
It's found you stumblin'
Stumblin' onto the heart of saturday night
And you're stumblin'
Stumblin onto the heart of saturday night
"
Jazz,"Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely
Heaven must have sent him my way

Skies above me
Never were as blue as his eyes
And he loves me
Who would want a sweeter surprise?

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me
There is nothing more I can say

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me
There is nothing more I can say

There is nothing more I can say
There is nothing more I can say
There is nothing more I can say
There is nothing more I can say"
Jazz,"My dear, I've a feeling you are
So near and yet so far
You appear like a radiant star
First so near then again so far

I just start getting you keen
On clinches galore with me
When fate steps in on the scene
And mops up the floor with me
No wonder I'm a bit under par
For you're so near and yet so far

My condition is only so-so
'Cause whenever I feel you're close, oh
You turn out to be, oh, so far

I just start getting you keen
On clinches galore with me
When fate steps in on the scene
And mops up the floor with me
No wonder I'm a bit under par
For you're so near and yet so far

My condition is only so-so
'Cause whenever I feel you're close, oh
You turn out to be, oh, so far"
Jazz,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!"
Jazz,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you"
Jazz,"It's a lazy afternoon
And the beetle bugs are zoomin'
And the tulip trees are bloomin'
And there's not another human in view
But us two.

It's a lazy afternoon
And the farmer leaves his reapin'
In the meadow cows are sleepin'
And the speckled trout stop leapin' up stream
As we dream.

A fat pink cloud hangs over the hill
Unfoldin' like a rose
If you hold my hand and sit real still  
You can hear the grass as it grows.

It's a hazy afternoon
And I know a place that's quiet, 'cept for daisies running riot 
And there's no one passing by it to see
Come spend this lazy afternoon with me"
Jazz,"Whats it all about Alfie?
Is it just for the moment we live?
Whats it all about when you started out Alfie?
Are we meant to take more than we give?
Or are we meant to be kind?

And if only fools are kind Alfie,
Then I guess it is wise to be cruel
And if life belongs only to the strong Alfie
What will you lend ought to know golden rule
As sure as I believe, 
There is a heaven above Alfie

I know there something much more
Something even nonbelievers can believe it

I believe in love Alfie (Alfie)
Without true love we just exist, Alfie
Until you find the love you've missed your nothing, Alfie
When you walk let your heart lead the way
And you'll find love any day

(Nonbelievers can believe it)

I believe in love Alfie (Alfie)
Without true love we just exist, Alfie
Until you find the love you've missed your nothing, Alfie
When you walk let your heart lead the way
And you'll find love any day, Alfie, Alfie, Alfie"
Jazz,"I'm a shadow since you're gone
Just a shadow in the dawn
That breaks in the sand
A shadow lost in shadowland

My poor hear just flew away
When it realized one day
The dreams that we planned
Would only end in shadowland

I always wondered
Why you had to go
Whatever blunder I mad
I don't know
I guess that something
Turned out wrong
Didn't quite belong
In this lover's song

I'm a shadow, but you know
I'm the one who loves you so
So please, take my hand
And lead me out of shadowland
And lead me out of shadowland"
Jazz,"In some secluded rendezvous
That overlooks the avenue
With someone sharing a delightful chat
Of this and that
And cocktails for two

As we enjoy a cigarette
To some exquisite chansonnette
Two hands are sure to slyly meet beneath
A serviette
With cocktails for two

My head may go reeling
But my heart will be obedient
With intoxicating kisses
For the principal ingredient

Most any afternoon at five
We'll be so glad we're both alive
Then maybe fortune will complete her plan
That all began
With cocktails for two"
Jazz,"I have but one heart This heart I bring you I have but one heart To share with you I have but one dream That I can cling to You are the one dream I pray comes true My darling, until I saw you I never felt this way And nobody else before you Ever has heard me say You are my one love My life, I live for you I have but one heart To give to you"
Jazz,"We gotta hustle ya'll We gotta hustle 



(Bootie Brown) 

Lookin to advance in this world that's monopolized so I utilize 

Careful not to jeopardize on my chances 

Some niggas pack 17 to stack their advances. 

I had a couple of homies that went to Kansas and Colorado. 

I never been one to follow 

I'm a lone desperado on the come up who rather sum up. 

Siskel gets paid to sit down with his thumb up. 

Asshole  watch cash flow take a downfall when your shit not on 

The ball. 

Who you gonna call? 



Hustle hustle hustle hustle 



(Schmooche) 

First you see a flash & then you smell smoke 

Schmooche cat, controllin the whole scene 

As my people choke, the hustle 

I want to be down & all off into it 

Like Russell Simmons, I like the women's 

The hers not the him, Ipass L's to my bredren 

In my pocket stacks ends 

But I always find myself saying, please excuse me sir 

Place down your bottle 

I didn't mean to step upon your eypps throttle 

And get her overheated ready to be treated 

For the Schmooche Cat addiction affection 

To her state and being I had her seeing triple visions 

Blue mountain tops and purple valley 

Wantin' to hang with her eypps in my alley 

Some do it illegal Brothas just want more than their equal 

Tryin not to get coated up in the evil This goes out to all my 

Hustling people... Just do it do it do it... do it do it do it 





(Randy Mac) 

Smokin doja in the south central streets keep me noid 

Til I puff bomb E T just to fill the void and recollect the word 

Of a Vet once put me down with Be about your paper mack and 

Watch 

The folks you clown with life's a hustle have money have heart 

My matrimony to this playa shit is death do us part 

And chasin papes from the nine six to infin 

Blazin endo stems sippin yack and straight Hen 

Gettin twisted out of shape like a pretzel Comin wit more cross 

Over appeal 

That Van Exel and I hope to God that I don't go to serve no 

Cavi stressin to maintain self preservation up in Cali 

My partners of mine are skyballin out of control 

But I ain't feelin that part of the game so 

Slow your roll and pump your brakes for goodness sakes 

I spot the fake the scandalous dulo one-time popo & the jakes 

Would love to ship my ass to Foledad or maybe Foesome 

But I recognize a trick-a-ration so I mob by my lonesome 

And see my status as a playa elevated as the hustler anthem 

For all the haters is regulated 

Some do it illegal Brothers just want more than their equal 

Tryin not to get caught up in the evil this goes out to all my 

Hustling people... just do it do it do it... do it do it do it 



(Big Boy) 

You see back in the days crime pays 

But now rhyme pays, so I had to hustle in many ways 

Now let me break this down 

I used to pack pipes like Wesley Snipes, and new jackin like 

Nini Brown 

Puttin suckas in fear 

Lettin ya know Big Boy is the nigga in charge over here 

I'm buying new shoes and new clothes 

Give me one of them two of these aw fuck it 

Nigga give me three of those 

My homie Shaun Juan used to give me 5 for 1 

Back in the days that's how my hustlin' shit was done 

Then that game went astray fools droppin dime 

Catchin time and brothas gettin blown away 

So Suavecito my Negrito put me with the Pharcyde 

Tours and pours of Hennessy by the barside 

Makin papes makin tapes doin dates 

All over the world in each and every state 

Now I'm on the other side of the tracks makin tracks 

But still got fat backs and fat stacks 

Yo Bootie Brown I guess I'm out 

Paper chase hustle that's what it be about 

Some do it illegal Brothas just want more than their equal 

Tryin not to get caught up in the evil this goes out to all my 

Hustling people... just do it do it do it... do it do it do it"
Jazz,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street"
Jazz,"Homesick tired All alone in a big city 
Why should ev'rybody pity me,
Nighttime's falling, folks are a singin', 
they dance till break of day
Dear Old Southland with it's dreamy songs 
Takes me back there where I belong 
How I'd love to be in mammy's arms
When It's Sleepy Time Down South
 

"
Jazz,"Can you help me I'm a pagan in this land of isolation I want love,I want life,I want freedom,keep on trying As a child I was a servant as a young man was still working for the kingdom of the steeple who gave nothing to the people You got one shot take it or not you let it run, I won't be one more notch in the butt of your stun gun Put your cards out on the table wash your mind of those old old fables that's enough rhinestone halo's read the fine print on the label You got one shot take it or not you let it run, you let it run I won't be one more notch in the butt of your stun gun in the butt of your stun gun. now the price is getting higherthrow yourself into the fire no more love, no more life, no more freedom, only crying You got one shot ready or not let it run, let it run I won't be one more notch in the butt of your stun gun You got one shot ready or not you let it run, gonna let it run cause I won't be one more notch in the butt of your stun gun in the butt of your stun gun. One more notch."
Jazz,I learned to swim when daddy threw me in the river The army taught me how to shine my shoes The years have shown me that nothin' lasts forever But everything I know about the blues I learned from you I thought I'd seen my share of bad luck and hard times But nothin' set me up for what you put me through I learned a lesson that will hurt me for a lifetime 'Cause everything I know about the blues I learned from you I know that promises are things that just get broken And you can't trust a woman's tears And if love is what you place your hope in All your hope may disappear In certain circles I've acquired a reputation But I give credit where credit is due Yes it's true I've got a first rate education 'Cause everything I know about the blues Everything I know about the blues Everything I know about the blues I learned from you
Jazz,"Dinner is ended, the music is grand,
Softly the lanterns gleam.
Isn't it splendid to sit hand in hand,
Silently lost in a dream?

Hands across the table
While the lights are low,
Tho' you hush your lips,
Your fingertips
Tell me all I want to know.
Hands across the table
Meet so tenderly,
And they say in their little way 
That you belong to me

Silence is golden, so do not reply,
And I shall understand.
All can be told in a look of your eye,
And in a touch of your hand.

Hand across the table
While the lights are low,
Tho' you hush your lips,
Your fingertips
Tell me all I want to know.
Hands across the table
Meet so tenderly,
And they say in their little way 
That you belong to me"
Jazz,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me."
Jazz,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon."
Jazz,"(Now you've gone now you've gone)
Since you've gone the moon the sun the stars in the sky
Know the reason why I cry
Love divine once was mine now you've gone

Since you've gone my heart my lips my tear dimmed eyes
A lonely soul within me cries
I acted smart broke your heart now you've gone
Oh what I'd give for the lifetime I've wasted
The love that I've tasted I was wrong now you've wrong
(Now you've gone now you've gone
Since you've gone my heart
(Now you've gone) now you've gone"
Jazz,"The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover, where can you be?
You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me

When I remember every little thing
You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me

When I remember every little thing
You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me"
Jazz,"Love laughs at a king Kings don't mean a thing On the street of dreams Dreams broken in two, can be made like new On the street of dreams Gold, sliver and gold All you can hold up there on a moonbeams Poor and nobody's poor Long as love is sure On the street of dreams All the gold, sliver and gold All you can hold up there on a moonbeam Poor, and nobody's poor Long as love is sure On the street of dreams"
Jazz,"Tv talkshows shining light
From every window
She pulls a dress on 
And she who cares where she goes

And wake up, wake up
Here's another day
And wake up, wake up
It's time your wide awake

And don't make promises
That don't mean anything
And wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up

It's light out honestly
It's time you're wide awake
Go where the party goes
Dressed up in shiny clothes

We drink the water
And it tastes like medicine
And wake up, wake up
Here's another day

And wake up, wake up
It's time your wide awake
And don't make promises
That don't mean anything

Watch the day go round
And wake up, wake up
Watch the sun go down
With all the animals

I watch the river run
And wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up

Jeannie talks too much
To all the animals
I hear a mad dog bark
She'll tell you what it said

Watch the day go round
And wake up, wake up
Watch the sun go down
With all the animals

I watch the river run
And wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up"
Jazz,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty"
Jazz,"It's a lazy afternoon
And the beetle bugs are zooming
And the tulip trees are blooming
And there's not another human in view

But us two
It's a lazy afternoon
And the farmer leaves his reaping
And the meadow cows are sleeping
And the speckled trouts stop leaping up stream

As we dream
A far pink cloud hangs over the hill
Unfolding like a rose
If you hold my hand and sit real still,
You can hear the grass as it grows

It's a hazy afternoon
And I know a place that's quiet, except for daisies running riot
And there's no one passing by it to see
Come spend this lazy afternoon with me"
Jazz,"This love of mine, goes on and on
Though life is empty, since you have gone
You're always on my mind, though out of sight
It's lonesome through the day and all the night

I cry my heart my out, it's bound to break
Since nothin' matters, then let it break
I ask the sun and the moon, the stars that shine
What's to become of it, this love of mine?

I cry my heart my out, it's bound to break
Since nothin' matters, then let it break
I ask the sun and the moon, the stars that shine
What's to become of it, this love of mine?"
Jazz,"Well I put the feeling off for so long I couldnt bare to see you moving on Cause nobody else can have you You told me what I gave was not enough And the dumbing down of love has made you numb You say that you dont feel anything at all Well now youre gonna feel it in your heart Like a bullet in your chest I thought itd be best To lay us to rest And now a smoking gun Is all that stands between us I tried to make, you understand Now theres blood, on my hands Now Im on the run, And my demons wont release me I couldnt be, a fool for love I had to go, and end it all With a smoking gun Now a kiss it never made you think straight And a bullet carries so much more weight And if were gonna be over, youre gonna be over Ill plead insanity, a jealous mans reprise Before they come and take me, make pay for all my sins Yeah youre gonna feel me in your heart Like a bullet in your chest So I thought itd be best To lay us to rest And now a smoking gun Is all that stands between us I tried to make, you understand Now theres blood, on my hands Now Im on the run, And my demons wont release me I couldnt be, a fool for love I had to go, and end it all With a smoking gun Youre gonna feel me in your heart Like a bullet in your chest So I thought itd be best To lay us to rest And now a smoking gun Is all that stands between us I tried to make, you understand Now theres blood, on my hands Now Im on the run, And my demons wont release me I couldnt be, a fool for love I had to go, and end it all With a smoking gun If its gonna be over, then youre gonna be over If its gonna be over, then youre gonna be over If its gonna be over, then youre gonna be over"
Jazz,"There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return

The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"
Jazz,"Who can I turn to when nobody needs me?
My heart wants to know and so I must go where destiny leads me
With no star to guide me and no one beside me
I'll go on my way and, after the day, the darkness will hide me

And maybe tomorrow I'll find what I'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow, beg, steal, or borrow my share of laughter
With you I could learn to, with you what a new day
But who can I turn to if you turn away?

With you I could learn to, with you what a new day
But who can I turn to if you turn away?"
Jazz,"Well now I'm just a poor young boy And these girls about to drive me wild Yeah I'm just a poor young boy And these girls about to drive me wild Well I-I'm just a poor young boy And these girls about to drive me wild The way they rock and roll and call me angel child The way they laugh, the way they sing It makes my heart go ting-a-ling The way they laugh, the way they sing It makes my heart go ting-a-ling The way they laugh, and si-i-ing Makes my heart go ting-a-ling Ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling Well, I'm young and I'm free And it's a real fine way to be Well I'm young and I'm free And it's a real fine way to be Well I-I'm young and I'm free-ee And it's a real fine way to be With a fine young thing to give her love to me"
Jazz,"Fancy me
Thought I had my degree
In life and how love
Ought to be right

I had a one step plan to prove it
Guide in my pocket for fools
Falling in love
Love had to show me one thing

I was so right thought I could
Turn emotion on and off
I was so sure but love taught me
Who was the boss

I defy anyone who claims
That I didn't control
Whatever moved
In my soul

I could touch, touch delight
Just because you fell for me
Why should I feel uptight
Love had to show me one thing

I was so right thought I could
Turn emotion on and off
I was so sure but love taught me
Who was the boss

I was so right thought I could
Turn emotion on and off
I was so sure but love taught me
Who was the boss

I was so right thought I could
Turn emotion on and off
I was so sure but love taught me
Who was the boss

I was so right thought I could
Turn emotion on and off
I was so sure but love taught me
Who was the boss

"
Jazz,"Whispering in his ear
My magic potion for love
Telling him, I'm sicere
And that there's nothing too good for us

Free, free
And I've just got to be me, me, me

Whispering in his ear
My magic potion for love
Telling him I'm sincere
And that nothing is too good for us

But I want to be free, free, free
And I've just got to be me, me, me

Teasing hands on his mind
Gives our nights such mystery
Happiness all the time
Oh and how that man pleases me

But I want to be free, free, free
And I've just got to be me, me, me

Feeling you close to me
Makes all my senses smile
Let's not waste ecstasy
'cause I'll be only here for a while

I've gotta be free, free, free, ooh
And I've just got to be me, me, me
Free, free
My devotion for love
I said got to be free


Free, free"
Jazz,"It's summertime and the living is easy Fish are jumping and the cotton is high Your daddy's rich and your mama's good-looking Hush, little baby don't you cry Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry No no no no Don't cry, don't cry One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing You spread your wings and take to the sky But until that morning there is nothing can harm you With your daddy and mommy standing by They are standing by, I know, don't cry Summertime, summertime, summertime and the living is, living is easy Fish are, I know the fish are jumping and cotton is so high Your daddy is so, so rich and your mama good- She had to be good-looking So hush, little baby, don't you cry Don't you cry, no no, don't cry No need to cry, don't cry, don't cry Summertime, summertime"
Jazz,"While love seasons will undo your soul
Time forgives us and it takes control
We separate our things to put us back together

We're light as a feather
Heavy as the weather
If it was rainstorms

Put our hands together to plough obey
It's like a show was over 
But we're too scared to walk away
All for the better
Worst for the way

We're light as a feather
Got you and I together

Meanwhile inside of me it was rainin' storms, hm,
You didn't know, hm
God bless your soul

We're light as a feather
Heavy as the weather
We're light as a feather
Got you and I together"
Jazz,"Don't mind the rain drops
Wait till the rain stops
Smile through your tears, laughing at life
No road is lonely, if you will only
Lose all your blues laughing at life
Live for tomorrow, be happy today
Laugh all your sorrows away
Start now and cheer up
The skies will clear up
Lose all your blues laughing at life

Don't mind the rain drops
Wait till the rain stops
You'll find the sun laughing at life
No road is lonely, if you will only
Smile through your tears, laugh at life
Live for tomorrow, be happy today
Laugh all your sorrows away
Start now and cheer up
The skies will clear up
Lose all your blues laughing at life"
Jazz,"I laughed at sweethearts I met at schools
All indiscreet hearts seemed romantic fools
A house in Iceland was my heart's domain
I saw your eyes; now castles rise in Spain

I took one look at you; that's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still
My feet could step and walk, my lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken, I could tell you knew
That un-felt clasp of hands told me so well you knew
I never lived at all until the thrill of that moment when
My heart stood still

Through all my school days I hated boys
Those April Fool days brought me loveless joys
I read my Plato, Love, I thought a sin
But since your kiss, I'm reading Missus Glyn"
Jazz,"(Julie)
It's the voice of my one love
And it promises ecstasy
Day and night it is calling me
But I'm afraid to go

(Julie)
Though I run to escape it
Still it calls irresistibly
And although it's my destiny
Sorrow is there, I know

Warm are his arms, tender his kiss
But in his eyes hidden, the danger lies

(Julie)
Must I go where he leads me?
Though it be through eternity
Oh, I know I will never be free
Free from the voice that calls
(Julie)"
Jazz,"Mister Paganini, please play my rhapsody
And if you cannot play it, won't you sing it
And if you can't sing it, you simply have to
Swing it

I said swing it
Oh-oh-oh swing it
And don't ding it
Oh mister Paganini, we breathlessly await

Your masterful d?tente, go-o on and sling it
And if you can't sling it
You'll simply have to swing it
I said swing it

And scattywahwah
And wahdyscatla
We've heard your repertoire and
At the final bar

We've greeted you with wild applause
But what a great ovation
Your interpretation
Pat-scoodle-atty-doody yeah yeah yeah

Oh Mister Paganini, now don't you be a meanie
What have you up your sleeve, go on and spring it
And if you can't spring it, you'll simply have to
Swing it"
Jazz,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head"
Jazz,"The sleepless nights - the daily fights
The quick toboggan - when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses - and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

The broken dates - the endless waits
The lovely loving - and the hateful hates
The conversation - with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain - no more strain
Now I'm sane - but I would rather be punch - drunk

The pulled out fur - of cat and cur
The fine mismatching - of a him and her
I've learned my lesson - but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh - the blackened eye
The words: ""I love you - 'til the day I die""
The self deception - that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals - it soon reveals
The faint aroma - of performing seals
The double-crossing - of a pair of heels
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care - no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now) - but I'd rather be punch drunk

Believe me sir - I much prefer
The classic battle - of a him and her
I don't like quiet - and I wish I were
In love again - in love again - in love again"
Jazz,"Porgy and all
I'm on my way to a heav'nly land
I'll ride that long, long road
If You are there to guide my hand
Oh Lawd, I'm on my way
I'm on my way to a heav'nly land
Oh Lawd, it's a long, long way, but
You'll be there to take my hand"
Jazz,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street"
Jazz,"High on a hill was a lonely goatherd
Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo
Loud was the voice of the lonely goatherd
Lay ee odl lay ee odl-oo

Folks in a town that was quite remote heard
Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo

Jazz,"You don't know what love is Until you've learned the meaning of the blues Until you've loved a love you had to loose You don't know what love is You don't know how lips hurt Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost Until you've flipped you're heart and you have lost You don't know what love is Do you know how a lost heart fears The thought of reminiscing And how lips have taste of tears Loose the taste for kissing You don't know how hearts burn For love that cannot live, yet never dies Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes You don't know what love is"
Jazz,"Do not wait until some deed of greatness you may do
Do not wait to shed your light afar
To the many duties ever near you now be true
Brighten the corner where you are

Brighten the corner where you are
Brighten the corner where you are
Someone far from harbor you may guide across the bar
Brighten the corner where you are

Just above are clouded skies that you may help to clear
Let not narrow self your way debar
Though into one heart alone may fall your song of cheer
Brighten the corner where you are

Here for all your talent you may surely find a need
Here reflect the bright and Morning Star
Even from your humble hand the Bread of Life may feed
Brighten the corner where you are"
Jazz,"Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style some day
Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way

Two drifters, off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend, moon river, and me

(moon river, wider than a mile)
(I'm crossin' you in style some day)
Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way

Two drifters, off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after that same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend, moon river, and me"
Jazz,"Every time it rains, it rains pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains pennies from heaven?
You'll find your fortune's fallin' all over the town
Be sure that your umbrella is upside down

Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love, you must have showers
So, when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me

Every time, every time it rains, it's gonna rain pennies from heaven
Don't you know every cloud contains lots of pennies from heaven
You'll find your fortune's fallin', baby, all over the town
Be sure, be sure that your umbrella is upside down

Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love, you've got to have showers
So, when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me"
Jazz,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is."
Jazz,"Quiet nights of quiet stars 
Quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us

Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams 
Quiet walks by quiet streams
And a window looking on the mountains and the sea, how lovely

This is where I want to be 
Here with you so close to me
Until the final flicker of life's ember

I, who was lost and lonely, believing life was only
A bitter tragic joke
I've found with you 
The meaning of existence, my love

I, who was lost and lonely, believing life was only
A bitter tragic joke
I've found with you 
The meaning of existence, oh my love"
Jazz,"Sometimes in the morning, when shadows are deep, 
I lie here beside you, just watching you sleep, 
And sometimes I whisper, what I`m thinking of, 
My cup runneth over with love . . . 
 
Sometimes in the evening, when you do not see, 
I study the small things, you do constantly, 
I memorize moments, that I`m fondest of, 
My cup runneth over with love . . . 
 
In only a moment, we both will be old, 
We won`t even notice the world turning cold. 
And so, in this moment, with sunlight above, 
My cup runneth over with love . . . 
 
With love . . ."
Jazz,"You go to my head

Jazz,"
I could change the world, 
I would be the sunlight in your universe. 
You would think my love was really something good, 
Baby if I could change the world. 
Baby if I could change the world. 
Baby if I could change the world.
"
Jazz,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.
Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.
Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.
Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon."
Jazz,"Good morning heartache, you old gloomy sight
Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down"
Jazz,"I knew the time had to come
When I'd be held under your thumb
I'm like a pawn in your hand
Moved and compelled, at your command
Whether it's for bad or for good
I would never change it if I could

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you
So if I laugh or I cry
I made my bed, that's where I'll lie
For what happens there's no excuse
I put my own head in the noose"
Jazz,"Eyes that look like heaven, lips like sherry wine
That girl can sure enough make my little light shine
I get a funny feelin' up and down my spine
Cause I know that my elvira's mine

So I'm singin'
Elvira, elvira
My heart's on fire elvira
Giddy up oom poppa omm poppa mow mow
Giddy up oom poppa omm poppa mow mow
Heigh-ho silver, away

Tonight I'm gonna meet her at the hungry house cafe
And I'm gonna give her all the love I can
She's gonna jump and holler 'cause I saved up my last two dollars
We're gonna search and find that preacher man

Now I'm a singin'
Elvira, elvira
My heart's on fire elvira
Giddy up oom poppa omm poppa mow mow
Giddy up oom poppa omm poppa mow mow
Heigh-ho silver, away"
Jazz,"I know that someday you'll want me to want you
When I'm in love with somebody else
You'll expect me to be true and to keep on loving you
Though I'm feeling blue
You'd think I can't forget you.

Until someday you'll want me to want you
When I'm strong for somebody new
And though you don't want me now
I'll get along somehow
And then I won't, won't want you.

(Orchestral Break)

Until someday you'll want me to want you
When I'm strong for somebody new
Although you don't want me now
I'll get along somehow
And then I won't, I won't want you.

Jazz,"You are my heat
You are my fire
Though you're not mine
I can't deny ya
Don't you hear me talking baby? 
Love me now or I'll go crazy

Jazz,"Yo whassup, this is Tajai of the mighty Souls of Mischief crew
I'm chillin with my man Phesto, my man A-Plus
And my man Op', you know he's dope (yo)
But right now y'know we just maxin in the studio
We hailin from East Oakland, California and, um
Sometimes it gets a little hectic out there
But right now, yo, we gonna up you on how we just chill

Dial the seven digits, call up Bridgette
Her man's a midget; plus she got friends, yo, I can dig it
Here's a forty, swig it, y'know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin in the cooler, break out the ruler
Damn! That's the fattest stog' I ever seen
The weather's heat in Cali; gettin weeded makes it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many females, so much inspiration

I get inspired by the blunts too
I'll front you, if you hang with a bunk crew
I roam the strip for bones to pick
When I find one, I'm done; take her home and quickly do this
I need not explain this (nahh)
A-Plus is famous - so get the anus!

Hey miss! Who's there? I'm through there
No time to do hair; the flick's at eight, so get straight
You look great - let's grub now
A rub down sounds flavor; later there's the theatre
We in the cut, the cinema, was mediocre
Take her to the crib so I can stroke her

Kids get broke for their skins when I'm in
Close range, I throws game at your dip like handball
Cause the man's all that
All phat, I be the chill from 93 'til

Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Uh-huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill, from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til

Huh, my black Timbs do me well (yeah)
When I see a fool and he says he heard me tell (what?)
Another person's business, I cause dizziness
Until you - stop acting like a silly bitch

Yo, crews are jealous cause we get props
The cops, wanna stop - our fun, but the top
Is where we're dwellin, swell and fat, no sleep
I work fit and jerks get their hoes sweeped
Under their noses, this bro's quick
Yo hit blunts and flip once I'm chillin cause my crew's close, kid

I'm posted, most kids accept this as cool
I exit, cause I'm an exception to the rule
I'm steppin - to the cool spots where crews flock to snare a dip
Or see where the shit that's flam B
Blam leakin out his pocket
So I got tons of indo and go to the Owen's basement, my ace been
Fattenin up tracks, Time to get prolific with the whiz kid

Greenbacks in stacks, don't even ask
Who got the fat sacks? We can max pumpin' fat tracks
Exchangin facts about impacts, cause in facts
My freestyle talent overpowers brothers can't hack.. it
They lack wit; we got the mack shit
93 'Til Infinity - kill all that wack shit

Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Uh-huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill, from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til

I be coolin; school's in session but I'm fresh in
Rappin so I take time off to never rhyme soft
I'm off on my own shit with my own clique
Roll many back roads with a fat stog' and blunt, folding runts
Holding stunts captive with my persona
Plus a bomber, zestin
Niggas is testin my patience; but I stay fresh and

Restin at the mall, attendance on 'noid
But I am shoppin for my wish to exploit
Some cute fits, some new kicks
I often do this cause it's the pits not bein dipped

Flip the flyer attire females desire
Baby you can step to this if you admire
The extraordinary dapper rapper
Keep tabs on your main squeeze before I tap her

I'll mack her; attack her with the smoothness
I do this, peepin what my crew gets (huh)
Loot, props, respect and blunts to pass
Crews talk shit, but in my face they kiss my ass (smak!)
They bite flows but we make up new ones
If you're really dope, why ain't ya signed yet?
But I get my loot from Jive/Zomba, I'mma bomb ya
You will see - from now 'til infinity

Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Uh-huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill, from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til

Hah-hah, just coolin out, y'know what I'm sayin
But, but who's chillin around the land y'know?
Yo, who's chillin? I think I know who's chillin
Yeah tell me who's chillin then then Plus

Casual you know he's chillin
Yo, Pep Love he gotta be chillin
Jay-Biz ya know he's chillin
Aiyyo man, my my man Snupe is chillin man
Yo Mike G you know he's here chillin
Heh, my man Mike P ya know he gotta chill
Del the Funky Homosapien is CHILLIN
Aiy ay my man Domino yo he's chillin

Everybody
Come and join the queue
I got some good advice that I'm gone give to you
When you're feeling like there's nothing you can do
Try to reach inside and you will find the truth

Don't just sit there
Complaining about your life
Time to stand up
Come on, you have got to fight
If you're feeling like you want to make it through
Learn to swim or else the tide will cover you

Can't you see the sun is dawning
Feel it coming
No more going through the motions
Ride the waves within the ocean
There's a new way
It's your destiny

This is your time... this is your time
(Open your eyes)

Contemplating

You can have anything you want
It's up to you
So much power
Lies deep inside of you
Just believe in yourself
You know what you must do

Don't you ever stop
Until you reach the top
Your destiny
She's calling out to you
There is no limit
So reach out and touch the moon

When you wake up every morning
Can't you see the sun is dawning
Feel it coming (feel it coming)
No more going through the motions
Ride the waves within the ocean

Jazz,"I love you that's what my heart is saying
While every breeze is playing our Cuban love song
I love you for all the joy you brought me
The lovely night you taught me our Cuban love song
One melody will always thrill my heart
One kiss will cheer me when we're far apart
(Dear one) I love you with such a tender passion 
and only you could fashion our Cuban love Song
 
I love you that's what my heart is saying
While every breeze is playing our Cuban love song
I love you for all the joy you brought me
The lovely night you taught me our Cuban love song
One melody will always thrill my heart
One kiss will cheer me when we're far apart
(Dear one) I love you with such a tender passion
"
Jazz,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain."
Jazz,"Lady, morning's just a moment away, 
And I'm without you once again.
You laughed at me, you said you've never needed me,
I wonder if you need me now.
We played the grams that people play, we made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Remembering the pain, if I must say, it's deep in my mind and locked away,
But then most of all, I do love you 
Still.
 
Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget,
Those feelings we can't put aside.
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand, 
But it's so heavy on my mind.
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say.
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down.
But then most of all, I do love you
Still.
 
We played the games that people play, 
We made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Cause I needed you so desperately.
We were too blind to see, but then,
Most of all, I do love you"
Jazz,"Those fingers in my hair
That sly come hither stare
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft

And I've got no defense for it
The heat is too intense for it
What good would common sense for it do

'Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
And although, I know, it's strictly taboo

When you arouse the need in my
My heart says yes indeed in me
Proceed with what your leading me to

It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you"
Jazz,"I've seen the lights of gay Broadway,
Old Market Street down by the Frisco Bay,
I've strolled the Prado, I've gambled on the Bourse;
The seven wonders of the world I've seen,
And many are the places I have been,
Take my advice, folks, and see Beale Street first!

You'll see pretty browns in beautiful gowns,
You'll see tailor-mades and hand-me-downs,
You'll meet honest men, and pick-pockets skilled,
You'll find that business never ceases 'til somebody gets killed!

If Beale Street could talk, if Beale Street could talk,
Married men would have to take their beds and walk,
Except one or two who never drink booze,
And the blind man on the corner singing ""Beale Street Blues!""

I'd rather be there than any place I know,
I'd rather be there than any place I know,
It's gonna take a sergeant for to make me go!

I'm goin' to the river, maybe by and by,
Yes, I'm goin' to the river, maybe by and by,
Because the river's wet, and Beale Street's done gone dry!"

Jazz,"Rosalie, my darling, 
Rosalie, my dream. 
Since one night when stars danced above, 
I'm oh, oh, so much in love, 
So Rosalie, have mercy. 
Rosalie, don't decline. 
Won't you make my life thrilling 
And tell me you're willing to be mine, 
Rosalie, mine."
Jazz,"My old flame
I can't even think of his name
But it's funny now and then
How my thoughts go flashing back again
To my old flame
My old flame
My new lovers all seem so tame
For I haven't met a gent
So innocent or elegant
As my old flame

I've met so many men
With fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes
Some who sent me up to the skies
But their attempts at love
Were only imitations of
My old flame
I can't even think of his name
But I'll never be the same
Until I discover what became
Of my old flame

I've met so many men
With fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes
Some who sent me up to the skies
But their attempts at love
Were only imitations of
My old flame
I can't even think of his name
But I'll never be the same
Until I discover what became
Of my old flame"
Jazz,"A few stolen moments is all that we share
You've got your family and they need you there
Though I've tried to resist being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own
But each time I try I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy
     
I've got to get ready just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night for feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love for you
Yes I'm saving all my love
Yes I'm saving all my love for you

No other woman is gonna love you more
'Cause tonight is the night that I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yeah I'm saving all my lovin'
Yes I'm saving all my love for you 
For you"
Jazz,I don't believe in competition Ain't nobody else like me around I don't need your inquisition It aint' that hard to figure it out Give it up now Play it cool Give it up now Play it cool All the rules that you use and abuse and No illusion can take this confusion Give it up now Don't let me down Don't think too much of my disposition You already know whats goin' down Don't want to be your exhibition no I don't want nobody hangin' around Give it up now Play it cool Give it up now Play it cool All the rules that you use and abuse and No illusion can take this confusion Give it up now Don't let me down
Jazz,"(Pass me by, pass me by
If you don't happen
To like it, pass me by)
I got me ten fine toes
To wiggle in the sand
Lots of idle
Fingers snap to my command
A loverly pair of heels
That kick
To beat the band
Contemplating nature
Can be fascinating
Add to these a nose
That I can thumb
And a mouth
By gum have I
So tell
The whole wide world
If you don't happen
To like it
Deal me out
Thank you kindly
Pass me by

That never saw a shine
Houses I could hold up
With a laundry line

A loverly patch that hide
An awful lot of spine
Shirtails flying
I'm a blooming dandelion
Add to these
A grin from ear to ear
All the proper gear have I
So tell

The thought of it
Bail me out
Thank you kindly

Jazz,"My heart tells me this is just a fling
And yet you say our love means everything
Do you mean what you are saying
Or is this a little game you're playing?

My heart tells me I will cry again
Lips that kiss like yours could lie again
If I'm fool enough to see this through, will I
Be sorry if I do? Should I believe my heart or you?

My heart tells me I will cry again
Cause lips that kiss like yours could lie again
If I'm fool enough to see this through, will I
Be sorry if I do? Should I believe my heart or you?"
Jazz,"What am I here for?
It's time you knew
Here's what I'm here for
I'm here for you

Can you forgive me?
Am I too late?
All the years that I've wandered
And pondered were squandered

My heart insisted
I seek you out
That you existed
My heart had no doubt

To share a journey
That leads to heaven's door
You'll find is what I'm here for

What am I here for?
It's time you knew
Here's what I'm here for
I'm here for you

Can you forgive me?
Am I too late?
All the years that I've wandered

Jazz,"The record is stuck on this same old tune
I wish you and I could get stuck like it too
I've served you a drink, a dozen of times
Glass after glass, to make the night last with you
But time won't stand still,
And once you've walked out the door
I might not see you no more
I have a picture in mind of which I can't let go
There's you and I but the rest of the world doesn't show
And I have studied every line and mark upon your face
So I can picture you at any time, in any place
Your words have meaning yet no sound
Cause they are drenched in the song to which we are bound
You look at me just like we have a past
You smoke every cigarette like it was your last
But time won't stand still
And soon you'll walk out the door
And I might not see you no more
I have a picture in mind of which I can't let go
There's you and I but the rest of the world doesn't show
And I have studied every line and mark upon your face
So I can picture you at any time, in any place
The record is stuck on this same old tune
Just as I'll always be stuck on you"
Jazz,"Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face 
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?"
Jazz,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know"
Jazz,"You've been getting nightmares Because something you didn't do We won't get to heaven unless we start to prove We been going nowhere and they've been traveling We won't get to heaven unless we stop the spin 'Cause this ain't going my way This ain't going my way This ain't going my way This ain't going my way But they know that you'll have to hesitate 'Cause it could be so fruitful all growing in the sun Picking prizes off the trees, our pride all said and done In love, my friends, hold hands till the end Because we are all just creatures, just walking on the land Feasting on the beauty, enough for everyone In love, my friends, hold hands till the end 'Cause this ain't going my way This ain't going my way No, this ain't going my way No, this ain't going my way But they know that you'll have to hesitate Hesitate, hesitate, hesitate So why aren't we evolving? Look what's to be done Setting back on evolution, it's up to everyone With love my friends, let's hope we mend Remember we are all just creatures roaming on this land You must feast on the beauty and lend your helping hand With love, my friends, together we must lend No, this ain't going our way No, this ain't going away No, this ain't going our way no This ain't going away 'Cause they know that you'll have to hesitate This ain't going my way, this ain't going our way Have to hesitate This ain't going my way, this ain't going our way Go, hesitate This ain't going my way, this ain't going our way Hesitate This ain't going my way, this ain't going our way Hesitate"
Jazz,"When the mellow moon begins to beam
Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he, for me.

Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong, the man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile; I'll understand
And in a little while he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home just meant for two
From which I'll never roam; who would? Would you?
And so all else above
I'm waiting for the man I love"
Jazz,"I love and you love
We love
Sweet love
I look and you look
And we found sweet love
And now we know
Love is the only thing
That matters at all
After all

I kiss and you kiss
Each kiss sweet lips
I tease and you squeeze
And we find sweet bliss
That's how we know
Love is the only thing
That matters at all
After all

I'm lucky
And you're lucky too
We're lucky
And we know it's true
Love is so wonderful

I give and you give
We live for love
Each night
Each day
We love sweet love
'Cause ain't it so?
Love is the only thing
That matters at all
After all

Love is the only thing
That matters at all
After all"
Jazz,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart"
Jazz,"These chords make her so happy, especially when he plays them that way What she says makes him so happy, complimenting him all day Well I don't love you, but I love your songs Well I don't love you, but your words make me feel like I belong She begs him to keep playing these chords even though he and they may get a little tired And he implores her to keep saying that stuff because her hollow words are keeping him inspired Well I don't love you, but your songs are keeping me amused Well I don't love you, but you'll do as an adequate muse Well I love the opticians, 'cause it's not your fault if your eyes are bad And they can't make you feel guilty, and they're hardly gonna blame your mum and dad The doctors and the dentists, can see how much you've indulged By learning of what condition you're in, they can tell what you've never divulged And it's up to you to look after yourself, which is so boring, ring, ring, bring me down Well I don't love you, but I love your songs Well I don't love you, but your words make me feel like I belong."
Jazz,"I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do 
If I had you
 
I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do"
Jazz,"Come away with me in the night
Come away with me
And I will write you a song

Come away with me on a bus
Come away where they can't tempt us, with their lies

And I want to walk with you
On a cloudy day
In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high
So won't you try to come

Come away with me and we'll kiss
On a mountaintop
Come away with me
And I'll never stop loving you

And I want to wake up with the rain
Falling on a tin roof
While I'm safe there in your arms
So all I ask is for you
To come away with me in the night
Come away with me"
Jazz,"I've been listening to the sounds of the night
Waiting for you to come around and hold me tight
I've been wanting you right here by my side

I don't care what you've gotta do
Just get here in a rush
Every part of me aches for you
It keeps getting stronger; I hunger, I long for you touch

[Chorus]
Hurry home
I'm counting the minutes until you are in my arms
Hurry home as fast as you can, baby
I'll be here ready to hold you; don't take it slow
Won't ya hurry home to me?

I miss the way you laugh off the blues
The way you're there to listen when I need you to
And, baby, how I'm needing you now

I know that you'll be coming soon
It's taking way too long
I asked the man up in the moon
To send you to me instantly back to where you belong

[Chorus]

And when you come back, when you walk through that door"
Jazz,"Want you to know I go for your squeezin'
Want you to know it really is pleasin'
Want you to know  I ain't for no teasin'
 
Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me
I get sentimental when you hold me tight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me 
Missing you since you went away
Singing the blues away each day
Counting the rights and waiting for you 
I'm in the mood to let you know 
I never knew I loved you so 
Please say you love me too 
When I get this feelin' I'm in ecstasy
So squeeze me but please don't tease me
 
Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me
I get sentimental when you hold me tight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me 
Missing you since you went away
Singing the blues away each day
Counting the rights and waiting for you 
I'm in the mood to let you know 
I never knew I loved you so 
Please say you love me too 
When I get this feelin' I'm in ecstasy
So squeeze me but please don't tease me
"
Jazz,"Baby, baby, baby don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me all by myself
I've got this burning, burning, yearning feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me and it hurts so bad

You came into my heart (baby, baby) so tenderly
With a burning love (baby, baby)
That stings like a bee (baby, baby)
Now that I surrender (baby, baby) so helplessly
You now want to leave (baby, baby)
Ooh, you wanna leave me (baby, baby)
Ooh (baby, baby)

Baby, baby, where did our love go?
Ooh, don't you want me?
Don't you want me no more (baby, baby)?
Ooh, baby

Baby, baby, where did our love go?
And all your promises of a love forevermore!
I've got this burning, burning, yearning feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me, and it hurts so bad

Before you won my heart (baby, baby)
You were a perfect guy
But now that you got me
You wanna leave me behind (baby, baby)
Ooh, baby

Baby, baby, baby don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me all by myself (baby, baby)
Ooh baby, baby, baby"
Jazz,"(1) You know he's gotta get away To the merry-go-round and round Count the times that he laid awake at night thinkin' Am I goin' down now Am I goin' down Am I goin' down now, oh! (2) It's not easy puttin' on a smile You're alone, lost and found She waits at home just to love him through the night thinkin' He's been gone so long now Is he comin' home? He's been gone so long now, oh! (Chorus) Merry-go-round and round (repeat) (1) [Chorus: Repeat 2X] She waits alone Just to love him through the night I'm coming home babe"
Jazz,I was combin' the corner I was shining my style I was blowin my horner I was runnin my miles I was stumblin the sidewalks I was strickin a match I was checkin my game Put the key to the latch Didn't flinch or nod cause my head is too thick Well I was lookin at and got hit by a brick Go ahead pop your gun Go ahead pout your lips Say the heat of the sun Has really got you whipped Go ahead use your charms Go ahead shake those hips Call the ambulance quick Cause I've been hit by a brick I was hit by a brick Didn't flinch or nod Like a nail to the head I was comin down hard I was pushin up daisies Saw the stars in my head Yeah my vision was hazy Must repeat what I said I didn't blink or stutter While takin my licks I was checkin you out And got hit by a brick I was hit by a brick Didn't flinch or nod Like a nail to the head I was comin down hard Didn't flinch or nod Cause my head is too thick Well I was lookin at you I got hit by a brick I was hit by a brick I was comin down hard I was hit by a brick Didn't flinch or nod Hit by a brick yeah Hit by a brick yeah Hit by a brick yeah Hit by a brick yeah yeah yeah
Jazz,"Dream beside me in the midnight glow, the lamp Is low Dream and watch the shadows came and go, the lamp Is low While you linger in my arms, my lips will sigh ""I love you so"" Dream the sweetest dream will ever know Tonight the moon is high, the lamp Is low Dream beside me in the midnight glow, the lamp Is low Dream and watch the shadows came and go, the lamp Is low While you linger in my arms, my lips will sigh ""I love you so"" Dream the sweetest dream will ever know Tonight the moon is high, the lamp Is low"
Jazz,"'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word
In a world of steel eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes an' blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Now there's a wall between us, somethin' there's been lost
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
And the one eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation an' they gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Well, I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

"
Jazz,"I didn't get my Dixie drawl
A-drinkin' out of a Dixie cup
Yes sir, I'm strictly from Dixie
And when I say, ""I loves you all""

It's meant to be on the up-and-up
Yes sir, I'm strictly from Dixie
When I came up from the South
I felt so down in the mouth

Then I took one look at you
And thought about Dixie skies of blue
I thought about sweet magnolias too
I never missed a cotton bowl

I like my tulips a trifle tall
Yes sir, I'm strictly from Dixie"
Jazz,If I should write a book for you That brought me fame and fortune too That book would be like my heart and me Dedicated to you And if I should paint a picture too That showed the loveliness of you My art would be like my heart and me Dedicated to you To you because your love is The beacon that lights up my way To you because with you I know One lifetime could be just one heavenly place If I should find a twinkling star One half so wondrous as you are That star would be like my heart and me Dedicated to you To you because your love is A beacon that lights up my way To you because with you I know One lifetime could be just one heavenly place If I should find a twinkling star One half so wondrous as you are That star would be like my heart and me Dedicated to you
Jazz,"Organ grinder, organ grinder
Organ grinder, play that melody
Take your organ, grinder, and grind some more for me

Grind it north, grind it north
Grind it north, grind it east or west
But when you grind it slow, that's when I like it best

Organ grinder, organ grinder
You don't have to pass your hat around any more
'Cause you're just the grinder I've been waitin' for

Organ grinder, organ grinder
Your sweet music seems to ease my mind
It's not only your organ, but it's the way you grind

Organ grinder, organ grinder
Organ grinder, you've found that sweet lost chord
Start grindin', and grind your room and board

Organ grinder, organ grinder
Organ grinder, don't tell me you're through
'Cause if you want a little intermission
Then mama's gonna grind a while for you

Organ grinder, organ grinder
Organ grinder, I will give you anything you choose
If you'll just cure my organ, of those grinding blues"
Jazz,"Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah

When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah

(Ooh) But he watch her so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day, that she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at he

Tall, (and) tan, (and) young, (and) lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, he smile - but she doesn't see
(Doesn't see)
(She just doesn't see, she never sees him)"
Jazz,"I dream of the summertime, 
Of Venice and the summertime.
I see the cafes, the sunlit days
With you, my love.
The antique shop where we'd stop
For a souvenir.
The bridge, the boats below,
The blue above.

I dream all the winter long,
Of violins that played our song.
The dream is so real I almost feel
Your lips on mine.
And though I know we have to be
An ocean apart, 
There's Venice and you, and summertime
Deep in my heart."
Jazz,"I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard, for love to ever last
My heart should be well schooled, 'cause I've been fooled in the past
And still I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
 
I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard, for love to ever last
My heart should be well schooled, 'cause I've been fooled in the past
And still I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast"
Jazz,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss"
Jazz,"Hey, where did we go
Days when the rains came ?
Down in the hollow
Playing a new game
Laughing and a-running, hey, hey
Skipping and a-jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumping
And you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine with a
Transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hide behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and a-sliding
All along the waterfall
With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
La dee dah

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown!
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometime I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Laying in the green grass
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah dee
Sha la la la la la la la la la la la la
Dee dah la dee dah la dee dah la

Jazz,"I can hear her heart beat for a thousand miles
And the heavens open every time she smiles
And when I come to her that's where I belong
Yet I'm running to her like a river's song

[Chorus:]
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief

[Chorus]

Yes I need her in the daytime
Yes I need her in the night
Yes I want to throw my arms around her
Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight

And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day
Yes it makes me righteous, yes it makes me feel whole
Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul"
Jazz,"Gee, how I miss
Your tender kiss,
And the wonderful things we would do.

Now I run my hands
Through silvery strands,
You left me blue turning gray over you.

You used to be
So good to me,
That's when I was a novelty.

Now, you've new friends in view,
You've found someone new,
And left me blue turning gray over you."
Jazz,"Chestnut roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost snipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe will help to make the season bright
Tiny little tots with their eyes all a, glow 
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies
On his sleigh
And every mother's child
Is gonna spy to see if
Reindeer really know how to fly
And so,
I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety, two
Although it's been said, many times
Many ways, Merry Christmas to you

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies
On his sleigh
And every mother's child
Is gonna spy to see if
Reindeer really know how to fly
And so,
I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety, two
Although it's been said, many times
Many ways, Merry Christmas [Repeat: x3]
To you"
Jazz,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when"
Jazz,"A lullaby my little guy to hush your cryin'
A lullaby you might recall when times are tryin'
And sing every day all that you're realizing
Know every song sung in lightness and Laughter
And don't play too long in the blues that come After
Take her along
Conquer your mountains again

A lullaby my little guy the moon is rising
You'll awake to see a sight that's worth the Prizing
That new morning star high on your heart's Horizon

If you're the one that always says bygones be Bygones
And when you look you've lost the ones
That you rely on
Look deep in your heart there's something to
Keep your eyes on

Cold distant stars slowly fade while you're Sleeping
And hollow guitars will be quietly weeping
So paint the skies with your bright shining
Castles in Spain

Among the things you do each day here's one
For trying
Give it all and give again and find reply in
That new morning star
High on your heart's horizon

Look it over,so much to see
Did I say you should look at me
Not just now
When I'm lookin' around
When my guard is down
Pieces on the ground

In a twinklin' and blinkin' eye
You'll be singing a lullaby
Say just how you can turn it around
When a faith is found
Even on the ground

Lullaby, now don't you cry my Suz and Ryan
So,lullaby and tell them why
there's no
Denyin' that new mornin' star
High on your heart's horizon
There's a new morning star high on your
Heart's horizon"
Jazz,"Rosalie, my darling, 
Rosalie, my dream. 
Since one night when stars danced above, 
I'm oh, oh, so much in love, 
So Rosalie, have mercy. 
Rosalie, don't decline. 
Won't you make my life thrilling 
And tell me you're willing to be mine, 
Rosalie, mine."
Jazz,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know"
Jazz,"December come to me
I hope I can see
You not just in dreams

I will let you be
Why can't you believe
How much you really mean

December won't you come
Back with snow even sun
Don't say that it's done

I will carry you home
Take you from the loneliest
Place you have known

I will carry you home
Take me from the loneliest
Place I have known"
Jazz,"We three, we're all alone, living in a memory
My echo, my shadow, and me
We three, we're not a crowd, we're not even company
My echo, my shadow, and me
What good is the moonlight, the silvery moonlight
That shines above?
I walk with my shadow, I talk with my echo
But where is the one I love?
We three, we'll wait for you, even till eternity
My echo, my shadow, and me"
Jazz,"Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style some day
Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way

Two drifters, off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend, Moon River, and me

(Moon river, wider than a mile)
(I'm crossin' you in style some day)
Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way

Two drifters, off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after that same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend, Moon River, and me

(Moon River, Moon River)"
Jazz,"If her voice can bring,
Every hope of Spring,
That's Judy,
My Judy,

If her eyes say ""yes"",
But you're wrong in your guess,
That's Judy,
My Judy.

If you hear her call,
In a soft, southern drawl,
""Hi! Stranger!"",
That's danger.

If you're smart; watch your heart,
She'll upset 'most any fellows apple cart!

In a hundred ways,
You'll be shouting her praise,
She'll let 'ya,
She'll get 'ya.

When she sees you fall,
She will will tell you ""That's all...""
""You wrtech 'ya!""
You betcha.

Then you'll know all the heartaches,
Of a fool just like me.

If she seem a saint,
And you'll find that she ain't,
That's Judy,
Sure as you're born!"
Jazz,"I have given you my true love, But you love a new love. What am I supposed to do now With you now, you're through? You'll be on your merry way And there's only this to say: I'm through with love I'll never fall again. Said adieu to love Don't ever call again. For I must have you or no one And so I'm through with love. I've locked my heart I'll keep my feelings there. I have stocked my heart With icy, frigid air. And I mean to care for no one Because I'm through with love. Why did you lead me To think you could care? You didn't need me For you had your share Of slaves around you To hound you and swear With deep emotion and devotion to you. Goodbye to spring and all it meant to me It can never bring the thing that used to be. For I must have you or no one And so I'm through with love. Why did you lead me To think you could care? You didn't need me for you had your share Of slaves around you to hound you and swear With deep emotion and devotion to you. Goodbye to spring and all it meant to me It can never bring the thing that used to be. For I must have you or no one And so I'm through with love."
Jazz,"Every time I think of you
I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue
It's no problem of mine
But it's a problem I find
Living a life that I can't leave behind

But there's no sense in telling me
The wisdom of the fool won't set you free
But that's the way that it goes
And it's what nobody knows
Well every day my confusion grows

Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say

I feel fine and I feel good
I'm feeling like I never should
Whenever I get this way
I just don't know what to say
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday?

I'm not sure what this could mean
I don't think you're what you seem
I do admit to myself
That if I hurt someone else
Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be

Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say

Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say

Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say"
Jazz,"{Look man! You're botherin' me G
I got shit to do right now, aight?
This is for De La Soul, you know what I'm sayin'?
Word up I got shit to do you test tube baby}

Check one two, check one two
De La Soul, is now back on the map
Long Island, is now back on the map
Good rap music, is now back on the map
Yo check one two, this is the voice of yours truly the Flava Flav
And I just want y'all to know, we ain't goin' nowhere
Old school is here to stay boy

On the outskirts, of what works
Live those who go for broke, and merk to get merked
Live by the sword and die by the semi
Not part of my ways, but stays right in my
N Y mentality for me, to be the best
The current, the ones who weren't
Pressed, to confess lies over hot joints
To sell to all who wanna hear some
(Young Guns these days got fireproof eardrums)

They don't give a shit who's hot
Just long as you're not, pussy and be the would-be king
But once crowned, the same wanna pull you down
(And what makes the world go 'round)
And I be the world renowned wonder why
Wonderin' why you can't stand me?
Is it because I'm the main Jackson?
And y'all just Titos and Randys? Yes it is
Bless the kid who hold his own head and expect to last

At the same time, I want respect and cash
And a few paragraphs in them books
Tellin' you how us native tongues made hits with no hooks
Rapped in every prefixes, gave birth to rap remixes back in '88
No disrespect to Diddy, just settin' it straight
Instead of zig-zaggin', got a degree in raggin'
My daughter says I'm a teen, 'cause like a teen
My pants always saggin' and I walk with a bop
The sex part of my time, I walked from my pop
No longer on timey and was never on loud
But cooked rhymes that make the chefs of Wu proud
I'm top cloud to rain on your show
And still anything goes when it comes to hoes because

Make you shake like, sunshine, naked shoe was once mine
Had bottom inner drawers and used to hit it from the mids
Fix your playground player or
Some kids'll come stomp in your sandbox
Swollen hands cocked back
No knives, no drama, no guns
No disrespectin' your seed of Ma Dukes
I puke rhyme and you laugh, take a sniff
Of these fricaseed raps on Carribean riffs
See last night's change was today's doe money
No time for your freestyles so roll money
No more whack albums with two joints
No more ballplayin' rappers who shoot ya two points
(No more G, 'cause I'm sick of your hip-hop!)

Your flows bore like seashores with no bitches
Switchhittin' niggaz will receive no pitches
No diamonds on the field, just keep the game real
Simple, see the God flows healthy
Wealth in the mind is like money in the bank
Exchange cash like thoughts in conversation
Thank you for your purchases, we doe out
And roll out the Kool-Aid, come and crop to see us pimp strut

Ain't really pimpin', I'm tryin' to catch the bus
The Krush Groove ain't got shit on Cold Crush
We dolly dolly babies 'cause we shootin' cats
'Back to the future' rap with Doc Brown shotgunnin' it
And pantyhose your whole style and start runnin' it
You dudes fiddle while we stay on the cello
The mush in your room son, we stay portobello
Can't settle for the same picket white fence
I got dreams of barbed wire in front of factories pa
Still push the truck with the factories pa
I'm bound to wreck the whip and turn insurance out, make 'em shout

Yeah that's right! Flava Flav, with De La Soul
Act bold, and we knock you straight up in the hole
You know what I'm sayin' six feet deep
That's the way that we keep, rollin'
You know what I'm sayin' operation tech sensation in the nation
Ready to take it to Penn station, you know what I'm sayin'
Yeah, ah ha ha ha

It's like, you know, how you gonna say

The top of the game niggas, is the one that's producing
Through out their career}

Jazz,"Baby baby, sweet baby
There's something that I just got to say
Baby baby, sweet baby
You left me hurtin' in a real cold way

Speak your name
And I'll feel a thrill
You said I do
And I said I will

I tell you that I'll stay true
and give you just a little time
Wait on me baby,
I want you to be all mine
I just get so blue

Since you've been gone, baby
(why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)
Since you've been gone
(why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)

(bridge)

Baby baby, sweet baby
I didn't mean to run you away
It was pride on my lips,
But not in my heart
To say the things that made you stray
But ah, babe
Hear me now
(hear me)
I don't know what I'm gonna do
(hear me)
Got to get you back somehow
(hear me now)
Oh, take me back,
consider me please
If you walk in that door,
I can get up off my knees
I just been so blue

Since you've been gone
(why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)
Since you've been gone
(why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)
Well I've been so lonely
(sweet sweet, sweet sweet baby)
Baby, since you've been gone

Jazz,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream"
Jazz,"And I wake up in the mornin' 
With my hair down in my eyes and she says ""Hi"" 
And I stumble to the breakfast table 
While the kids are goin' off to school goodbye 
And she reaches out 'n' takes my hand 
And squeezes it 'n' says ""How ya feelin', hon?"" 
And I look across at smilin' lips 
That warm my heart and see my mornin' sun 
 
And if that's not lovin' me 
Then all I've got to say 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss 
Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And when my self is feelin' low 
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind 
 
Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy 
And ask her if she could get away and meet me 
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me 
'cause she's made that way 
 
And if that ain't lovin' me 
Then all I've got to say 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes 
And there's no such thing as make-believe 
Puppy dogs, autumn leaves 'n' BB guns 
 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis"
Jazz,"Born in the heat of the desert
My mother died givin' me life
Deprived of the love of a father
Blamed for the loss of his wife
You know Lord I've been in a prison
For something that I've never done
It's been one hill after another
And I've climbed them all one by one

Oh but this time Lord you gave me a mountain,
A mountain you know I may never climb
It isn't just a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time

My woman got tired of the heartaches
Tired of the grief and the strife,
So tired of working for nothing
Just tired of being my wife
She took my one ray of sunshine
She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living
She took my small baby boy

Yeah but this time Lord you gave me a mountain, 
A mountain I may never climb
It isn't a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time
Yeah Lord, You gave me a mountain
Don't you know 
You gave me a mountain this time"
Jazz,"Antonia
Soon you will out grow my arms
Soon enough you'll discover
Other boys have charms

Antonia, woman child
Won't be long, you drive 'em wild
But in the meantime, stay your daddy's girl
And wrap me round your little finger

Antonia, take it slow
When it's right, you let me know
But in the meantime let me be the guy
One you turn to till you learn to fly

Antonia
Soon you will out grow my arms
Soon enough you'll discover
Other boys have charms

Antonia, you will bloom
Leaving me your empty room
And anytime I'm lonely, I can find
The teddy bear and pony Antonia left behind"
Jazz,"How does it feel to be 
One of the beautiful people 
Now that you know who you are 
What do you want to be 
And have you traveled very far 
Far as the eye can see 

How does it feel to be 
One of the beautiful people 
How often have you been there 
Often enough to know 
What did you see when you were there 
Nothing that doesn't show 

Baby you're a rich man 
Baby you're a rich man 
Baby you're a rich man, too 
You keep all your money in a big brown bag 
Inside a zoo, what a thing to do 
Baby you're a rich man 
Baby you're a rich man 
Baby you're a rich man, too 

How does it feel to be 
One of the beautiful people 
Tuned to a natural E 
Happy to be that way 
Now that you've found another key 
What are you going to play 

Baby you're a rich man 
Baby you're a rich man 
Baby you're a rich man, too 
You keep all your money in a big brown bag 
Inside a zoo, what a thing to do

Jazz,"The boys watch the girls while the girls watch the boys who watch the girls go by
Eye to eye, they solemnly convene to make the scene
Which is the name of the game, watch a guy watch a dame on any street in town
Up and down and over and across, romance is boss

Guys talk ""girl talk"", it happens everywhere
Eyes watch girls walk with tender lovin' care

It's keepin' track of the fact watching them watching back 
That makes the world go 'round
""What's that sound?"" each time you hear a loud collective sigh
They're making music to watch girls by

Jazz,"The dark is filled with dreams
So many dreams, which one is mine?
One must be right for me

Which dream of all the dreams
When there's a dream for every star
And there are oh so many stars, so many stars

The wind is filled with songs
So many songs, which one is mine?
One must be right for me

Which song of all the songs
When there's a song for every star
And there are oh so many stars, so many stars

Along the countless days, the endless nights
That I have searched so many eyes
So many hearts, so many smiles

Which one to choose, which way to go?
How can I tell, how will I know out of
Oh, so many stars, so many stars?

Along the countless days, the endless nights
That I have searched so many eyes
So many hearts, so many smiles

Which one to choose, which way to go?
How can I tell, how will I know out of

So many stars, so many stars, so many stars"
Jazz,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you."
Jazz,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me"
Jazz,"Love oh love careless love
Love oh love careless love
Love oh love oh careless love
See what careless love has done

Once I wore my apron low 
Once I wore my apron low
Once I wore my apron low
I couldn't keep you from my door

What oh what will mama say
What oh what will mama say
What oh what will mama say
When she learns I've gone astray

I love my mama and papa too 
I love my mama and papa too
I love my mama and papa too
See what I get for lovin' you

Now I wear my apron high 
Now I wear my apron high
Now I wear my apron high
You pass my door you walk on by"
Jazz,"cut the cord that opens up my jaw
as all these words run
i'm out of breath from kicking cans at god
and i said
jesus christ
the nights are much too long
i'm tired of throwing bodies at the moon
i'm sure i will be caught soon
and then i had this dream i was fast as lightning
flying in a suitcase over these islands
but this time i did
i'm not waking up
get it right this time
i'm throwing lassos at the sky
catching moments as big as my eyes
intoxicating like
like we're on a gold mine
get it right this time
i'm throwing islands at your eyes
that's right you got me practicing lies
intoxicating like
like we're on a gold mine
cut the curtains fall around my head
yesterday is dead
i can't erase the stupid things i did
and i said jesus christ
the nights are much too strong
i'm tired of throwing bottles at the sun
i'm sure we won't be here long
and then i had this dream i was fast as lightning
flying in a suitcase over these islands
but this time i did
i'm not waking up
get it right this time
i'm throwing lassos at the sky
catching moments as big as my eyes
intoxicating like
like we're on a gold mine
get it right this time
i'm throwing islands at your eyes
that's right you got me practicing lies
intoxicating like
and maybe i've been thinking about the molecules i've been breathing
and now my skin's so soft it breaks with every breath i'm taking
and now my blood is full of airplanes and they're flying me away
from all these god damn dirt bag neighborhoods
saying don't look back
don't you dare look back at me
alright this time
we're throwing models at the sun
won't be here for too long
intoxicating like
intoxicating
get it right this time
i'm throwing islands at your eyes
that's right you got me practicing lies
intoxicating like
like
like
get it right this time
i'm throwing lassos at the sky
catching moments as big as my eyes
intoxicating like
don't look back
don't you dare look back now
get it right this time
i'm throwing islands at your eyes
that's right you got me practicing lies
intoxicating like
like we're on a gold mine"
Jazz,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love"
Jazz,"I hadn't anyone till you,
I was a lonely one 'til you,
I used to lie awake and wonder if there could be
A someone in the wide world just made for me,
Now I see

I had to save my love for you, (I saved my love for you)
I never gave my love 'til you, (I saved it all for you)
And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.

I kept my love in secrecy,
I put it under lock and key,
I had to save my love for you!
I never gave my love away,
I waited for that lucky day
When I could give it to you

And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you."
Jazz,"Paradise can not refuse us
Never such a happy pair

Everybody must excuse us
If we walk on air

All the shadows now will lose us
Lucky stars are everywhere

As a happy being
Here's what I'm foreseeing

For you, for me, forever more
It's bound to be forever more

It's plain to see
We found, by finding each other
The love we waited for

I'm yours, you're mine
And in our hearts
The happy ending starts

What a lovely world
This world will be
With a world of love in store
For you, for me, forever more.

What a lovely world
This world will be
With a world of love in store
For you, for me, forever more."
Jazz,"It's the Booker-man, y'all Can you dig it Yeah, yeah, that's it man Can you dig it That's what I'm talkin' about Can you dig it Can you dig it, sucka Can you dig it Yeah, it's all real You can find me center stage, center of attention Booker T's here like Vin Diesel triple x-ing On the count of three, I want you all to spit it, One, two, three, can you dig it, sucka Five time's the champ, more the man Scuffle with me, not a good plan Gotta show the world a better way for the youth All eyes on me, Booker T's the truth Whatever the state, wherever you at Booker put it down man, simple as that Booker ain't hating, ain't dissin' a thing No more drama in my life, feel the vibe I bring Don't be fooled because he bruised Booker T the type to come speak at cha school Wherever you at, I talk it like I walk it I walk it like I live it If you know the words, hit it Can you dig it, sucka Ever since Harlem Heat, hard to beat WCW Champ, plus four repeats Want to get down? You're gonna lay down When you lay down, you're gonna stay down Want to know 'bout my life, it's an open book Most can't make it down the road I took Booker made a change in his life, just like Mase Now Booker get respect when he come in the place Man this ain't about guns and drugs and ill thugs This is bout makin' it better for lil' 'cause Can you dig it, sucka, understand the way Booker so humble, in this concrete jungle Right or wrong I rumble, till the wrong tumble From giants to midgets, Can you dig it Larger than life, but it's no movie I'm the true master of the spinaroonie Can you dig it, sucka"
Jazz,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!"
Jazz,"A time for summer skies
For hummingbirds and butterflies
For tender words that harmonize with love

A time for climbing hills
For leaning out of windowsills
Admiring daffodils above

A time for holding hands together
A time for rainbow coloured weather
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of

As time goes drifting by
The willow bends and so do I
But all my friends whatever skies above
I know a time for spring
A time for fall
But best of all
A time for love

A time for holding hands together
A time for rainbow coloured weather
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of

As time goes drifting by
The willow bends and so do I
But all my friends whatever skies above
I know a time for spring
A time for fall
But best of all
A time for love"
Jazz,"I don't believe in frettin' and grievin';
Why mess around with strife?
I never was cut out to step and strut out.
Give me the simple life.

Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant.
Those things roll off my knife;
Just serve me tomatoes; and mashed potatoes;
Give me the simple life.

A cottage small is all I'm after,
Not one that's spacious and wide.
A house that rings with joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside.

Some like the high road, I like the low road,
Free from the care and strife.
Sounds corny and seedy, but yes, indeed-y;
Give me the simple life."
Jazz,"My gal and I, we had a fight 
And I'm all by myself
I guess she thinks now that she's gone
I'll lay right on the shelf
I'm gonna show her she's all wrong
No lonesome stuff for mine
I won't sit home, all alone
She'll soon find that I'm
 
Runnin' wild,  lost control
Runnin' wild, mighty bold
Feelin' gay, reckless too
Care free mind all the time, never blue
Always goin' don't know where
Always showin', I don't care
Don't love nobody, it's not worth while
All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
 
When I first met that gal of mine
It seemed just like a dream
But when she tho't she had me right
She started actin' mean
Like mary led her little lamb 
She led me all the time
Until the worm had to turn
That's the reason I'm
 
Runnin' wild,  lost control
Runnin' wild, mighty bold
Feelin' gay, reckless too
Care free mind all the time, never blue
Always goin' don't know where
Always showin', I don't care
Don't love nobody, it's not worth while
All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
 
No gal will ever make a fool of me
No gal! I mean just what I say
I ain't the simpleton I used to be
Wonder how I got that way
 
Once I was full of sentiment, it's true
But now I got a cruel heart
With all that other foolishness I'm through
Gonna play the Villain part
 
Runnin' wild,  lost control
Runnin' wild, mighty bold
Feelin' gay, reckless too
Care free mind all the time, never blue
Always goin' don't know where
Always showin', I don't care
Don't love nobody, it's not worth while
All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
"
Jazz,"Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you.

Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you.

On the day that you were born
And the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue.

That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you.

Jazz,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love."
Jazz,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues""."
Jazz,"Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette, hanging out his mouth he's a cowboy kid
Yeah found a six shooter gun
In his dad's closet hidden oh in a box of fun things, I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah he's coming for you

Daddy works a long day
He be coming home late, he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
I've waited for a long time
Yeah the slight of my hand is now a quick pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
And say your hair's on fire, you must have lost your wits, yeah

Jazz,"L is for the way you look at me.
O is for the only one I see.
V is very, very extraordinary.
E is even more than anyone that you adore can.

Love is all that I can give to you,
Love is more than just a game for two.
Two in love can make it.
Take my heart and please don't break it,
Love was made for me and you.

Jazz,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon."
Jazz,Supper time I should set the table 'Cause it's supper time Somehow I'm not able 'Cause that man o'mine Ain't comin' home no more Supper time Kids will soon be yellin' For their supper time How'll I keep from tellin' Them that man o'mine Ain't comin' home no more? How'll I keep explainin' when they ask me where he's gone? How'll I keep from cryin' when I bring their supper on? How can I remind them to pray at their humble board? How can I be thankful when they start to thank the lord Lord! Supper time I should set the table 'Cause it's supper time Somehow I'm not able 'Cause that man o'mine Ain't comin' home no more

Jazz,"""Clang, clang, clang"" went the trolley
""Ding, ding, ding"" went the bell
""Zing, zing, zing"" went my heartstrings
For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the line"
Jazz,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine"
Jazz,"Me and my wife live all alone 
In a little log hut we're all our own
She loves gin and I love rum, 
And don't we have a lot of fun! 

Ha, ha, ha, you and me, 
Little brown jug, don't I love thee! 
Ha, ha, ha, you and me, 
Little brown jug, don't I love thee! 
When I go toiling on the farm 
I take the little jug under my arm

Place it under a shady tree, 
Little brown jug, 'tis you and me. 
'Tis you that makes me friends and foes, 
'Tis you that makes me wear old clothes
But, seeing you're so near my nose, 
Tip her up and down she goes. 

If all the folks in Adam's race 
Were gathered together in one place, 
Then I'd prepare to shed a tear
(I'd let them go without a tear) 
Before I'd part from you, my dear. 

If I'd a cow that gave such milk, 
I'd dress her in the finest silk; 
Feed her up on oats and hay, 
And milk her twenty times a day. 

I bought a cow from Farmer Jones, 
And she was nothing but skin and bones
I fed her up as fine as silk, 
She jumped the fence and strained her milk. 

And when I die don't bury me at all, 
Just pickle my bones in alcohol
I'ut a bottle o' booze at my head and feet 
And then I know that I will keep. 

The rose is red, my nose is too, 
The violets blue and so are you
And yet, I guess, before I stop, 
We'd better take another drop."
Jazz,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me"
Jazz,"It isn't alcohol no yaller gal at all 
thrills me fills me with the pep I've got

I've got a pair of feet
That found a low down beat
Low down, down around a spot that's hot!

I've got no peace
I'm losin' my lease on livin'
Here's the how?
I'm tellin' you now to give in!

Oh, make 'em play that crazy thing again
I've gotta do that lazy swing again.
Heigh, ho, doin' the new low down.

I got my feet to misbehavin' now,
I got a soul that's not for savin' now.
Heigh, ho, doin' the new low down.

That dancin' demon has my feet in a trance,
'cause while I'm dreamin'
I go into that dance

And once you hear the haunting strain to it,
I'd like to bet you'll go insane to it.
Heigh, ho, doin' the new low down.
"
Jazz,"There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,
There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,
The corn is as high as an elephants eye,
An' it looks like it's climbing clear up in the sky.

Oh, what a beautiful mornin',
Oh, what a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way.

All the cattle are standin' like statues,
All the cattle are standin' like statues,
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by,
But a little brown mav'rick is winkin' her eye.

Oh, what a beautiful mornin',
Oh, what a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way.

All the sounds of the earth are like music
All the sounds of the earth are like music
The breeze is so busy it don't miss a tree
And an old weepin' willer is laughin' at me

Oh, what a beautiful mornin',
Oh, what a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way."
Jazz,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart
 
You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd

Jazz,"Well I came home one mornin', found my baby gone Well you know I always lived all alone Oh, I love her, Yes, I love her Sho' nuff I do First time I saw her, on a Friday night I told her baby, I told everything was alright Oh, I love her, Yes, I love her Sho' nuff I do I saw her one mornin', she was goin' round the street She was shakin' hands with every man she meet Oh, I love her, Yes, I love her Sho' nuff I do I raise my hands once again Baby if you please, baby please understand Oh, I love her, Yes, I love her Sho' nuff I do"
Jazz,"I was never spellbound by a starry sky
What is there to moon glow, when love has passed you by
Then there came a midnight and the world was new
Now here am I so spellbound, darling
Not by stars, but just by you
 
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song
At Last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I can speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known
You smiled and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven 
For you are mine at last
 
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song
At last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I can speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known
You smiled and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven"
Jazz,"I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves then I recall
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms
Of course I do
But I've forgotten you just like I should
Of course I have
Except to hear your name
Or someone's laughter just the same
But I've forgotten you just like I should

[Chorus]
What, again
What a fool am I
To think my breaking heart could kick the mood
What's in store
Should I phone once more
No, it's best that I stick to my tune

I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except perhaps in Spring
But I should never think of Spring
For that would surely break my heart in two

[Chorus]"
Jazz,"Love your skimmer Judy, where did you grab it?

My hat?
Oh Bing, how nice of you to ask me that.
Because there's a very interesting story 
Connected with this hat, there really is.
I was walking down the street the other day,
Ran into Mllicent Palmer, you know Millicent Palmer,
A very dear friend of mine.

How do I get involved?

Well we walked around the corner for what passes
For a millinery shop and she looked in the window and
Saw my hat and said, ""that is for you""
I went in, the saleslady put it on my head and I 
Thought it was a little matronly 

Time

Oh, now wait, no wait

Cut

When I got my arm around you and we're going for a walk
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, talk, talk, talk
When we're sitting close together in a cozy taxi cab
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, gab, gab, gab
Aristotle, mathematics, economics, antique chairs
The classics, the comics, darling, who cares?
There's a brand new moon this evening and the weather should be fine
If you  ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, same old line
I'll politely close your lips with mine

How's your golf Bing?

My golf? Ho-ho I'm really moving that ball out there, striking it a ton.
I had a sixty-nine Sunday, should have been a sixty-five.
Terrific wind blowing, couldn't drop a single putt, it was murder

Oh, I lost my head with this question

And of course the equipment, you just can't get any golf balls anymore
The actors are hoarding them all...and the caddies, huh they want an 
Annuity for eighteen holes. You've got to take an option on one to be sure
He'll show up.

Cut
Sorry
When the parlour lights are lowered and the family isn't in
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, chin, chin, chin
When there's music softly playing and I'm sitting on your lap
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, yap, yap, yap
Forward passes, second baggers, or a jockey who is hot.
Or boxing, or hockey, darling, so what?

I'll attempt some other evening.
Well you can call for me at nine

Calling?
But if you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, same old line
What do you mean the same old line?
Same line

You asked me about my hat,
You've been standing there for an hour 
And a half talking your big fat head off

I thought
About golf

I just
You didn't even let me finish my story
I told you what I would do
Oh darling, let me finish
Steady, steady

Oh
It's so nice to close your lips with mine."
Jazz,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true"
Jazz,"It's not the pale moon that excites me, 
That thrills and delights me, 
Oh no, it's just the nearness of you

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, 
Oh no, it's just the nearness of you. 

When you're in my arms 
And I feel you so close to me, 
All my wildest dreams come true 
I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night 
The nearness of you!"
Jazz,"Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled

Joyful, all ye nations, rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With the angelic host proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born King

Christ, by highest heaven adored
Christ, the everlasting Lord
Late in time behold him come
Offspring of the Virgin's womb

Joyful, all ye nations, rise
Join the triumph of the skies
Pleased as man with man to dwell
Jesus, our Emmanuel!
Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born King

Hail the Heaven-born

Jazz,"Walk in the light
That shines so bright
Let your soul feel right
Love is pure gold, yeah

Won't you wake up, wake up, walk in the light?
Won't you wake up, wake up, bring substance in your life?

As you live from day to day
(As you live from day to day)
'Cause only true love makes things better, yeah
'Cause true love never fades away, oh

"
Jazz,"I jump up at down, shake out the sun
Laugh like a loon; everything is fun
It's crazy, but I'm in love

I act like a fool; what do I care?
I'll be a fool as long as you're there
It's crazy, but I'm in love

I spread my wings and then I fly
All around the city
The world's my sweet potato pie
And I'm sittin' mighty pretty

I sleep by the stars, chase that old moon
Fall into the bed hummin' a tune
It's crazy, but I'm in love"
Jazz,"On the first of may, it is moving day,
Spring is here, so blow your job,
Throw your job away!

Now's the time to trust,
To your wanderlust,
In the city's dust you wait, must you wait
Just you wait.......!

In a mountain greenery,
Where god paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together.

While you love your lover,
Let blue skies, be your cover-let,
When it rains we'll laugh at the weather.

And if you're good,
I'll search for wood,
So you can cook... while i stand look-in'

Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery
Bless our mountain greenery home!

Mosquitoes here,
Won't bite you dear,
I'll let them sting, me on the finger!

We could find no cleaner retreat from life's machinery
Then our mountain greenery home."
Jazz,"Let me be your weeping willow tree
Surround you with my long limbs
My dear, let me grow in the shade
In the sands by the bank of your river
Let I drink from your streams
The cool breeze fill my leaves

We will sing together
Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

I wish I was a weeping willow tree
I wish I was a weeping willow tree

I wish I was a weeping willow tree
Sweet river caress how softly
Stir my searching roots
Shading the sun in the summers heat
Let I cool you
We have been dancing so long
In the winters freeze and the summers drought
We survive
We belong
Let us sing together
Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

I wish I was your weeping willow tree
I wish I was a weeping willow tree
I wish I was a weeping willow tree

Let us sing together
Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

Let us sing together
Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

We can sing together
Water over the pebbles
And I'll be by your side forever

Let me be
Your willow tree
Your willow tree
"
Jazz,"Your cheatin' heart will make you weep
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep
But sleep won't come the whole night through
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

When tears come down like fallin' rain
You'll toss around and call my name
You're gonna walk that floor the way I do
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

When tears come down like fallin' rain
You'll toss around and call my name
You're gonna walk that floor the way I do
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you"
Jazz,"Arriverderci, Roma Goodbye, goodbye to Rome City of a million moon lit faces City of a million warm embraces Where I found the one of all the faces Far from home Arriverderci, Roma It's time for us to part Save the wedding bells for my returning Keep my lover's arms outstretched and yearning Please be sure the flame of love keeps burning In her heart Arriverderci, Roma It's time for us to part Save the wedding bells for my returning Keep my lover's arms outstretched and yearning Please be sure the flame of love keeps burning In her heart"
Jazz,"(I can't stop loving you)
I've made up my mind
To live in memory of the lonesome times
(I can't stop wanting you)
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday
(Dreams of yesterday)

Those happy hours that we once knew
Though long ago, they still make me blue
They say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart

(I can't stop loving you)
I've made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
(I can't stop wanting you)
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday

(Those happy hours) (2x)
(That we once knew) (2x)
(Though long ago) (2x)
(Still make me blue)
Still make me blue
(They say that time) (2x)
(Heals a broken heart) (2x)
(But time has stood still) 
Time has stood still 
(Since we've been apart) (2x)

(I can't stop loving you)
I said I made up my mind
To live in memory of the lonesome times
Sing a song, children
(I can't stop wanting you)
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life of dreams of yesterday
(Of yesterday)"
Jazz,"The plot begins with you
And me in darklit rooms
Your cigarette cuts through
I wear it like perfume

The melody gives way
We silently behave
The story never ends
Is torn up into shreds
I see it in your eyes
Invitation lies
But pages left to turn
Our chapters we should burn

The melody gives way
We silently behave
The story never end
Is torn up into shreds

I see it in your eyes
An Invitation lies
But pages left to turn
Our chapters we should burn"
Jazz,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart
 
You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart"
Jazz,"You left today but you didn't say goodbye I wonder why I'm standing now where you made your vow So blue for you, I could cry Leaves come tumbling down 'round my head Some of them are brown, some are red Beautiful to see, but reminding me Of a faded summer love Swaying high above in the trees They were so in love with the breeze Now the autumn wind brings to them the end Of a faded summer love I'm like the poor leaves that sway with the breeze I thought that life was sweet You are the sweet breeze that tried hard to please Then swept me off my feet Summer morning dew turns to frost Leaves that once were new pay the cost Beautiful to see, but reminding me Of a faded summer love I'm like the poor leaves that sway with breeze I thought that life was sweet You are the sweet breeze that tried hard to please Then swept me off my feet Summer morning dew turns to frost Leaves that once were new pay the cost Beautiful to see, but reminding me Of a faded summer love"
Jazz,"I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love.

Tell me please,
Where can he be,
The loving he who'll bring to me
The harmony I'm dreaming of.

It'll be goodbye, I know
To my tale of woe,
When he says ""Hello!""

So I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love!"
Jazz,"We have been gay, going our way
Life has been beautiful, we have been young
After you've gone, life will go on
Like an old song we have sung

When I grow too old to dream
I'll have you to remember
When I grow too old to dream
Your love will live in my heart
So, kiss me my sweet
And so let us part

And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart
And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart

So, kiss me my sweet
And so let us part
And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart"
Jazz,"I only meant to love you
Don't you know it, babe?
Why couldn't you be contented
With the love I gave?
I've given you my heart
But now you want my mind
Your love scares me to death, girl
It's the chokin' kind
You can kill a man
With bullets, poison, or a knife
But it hurts him more
To take his pride and run his life
Whatever it is you want, girl
Lord, I hope you find
But that hat don't fit my head
It's the chokin' kind

When you fall in love again, girl
Take a tip from me
If you don't like the peaches
Walk on by the tree
Find what you want and keep it
Treat it sweet and kind
But let it breathe
Don't make your love the chokin' kind
Oh baby, bye bye, baby, bye bye, baby bye bye, oh baby, bye bye
Bye bye, baby, baby, bye bye"
Jazz,"Darling, I really wanna know Am I in your plan? Can I be your man? Darling, I'll never leave your side If you'd be my blushing bride I just wanna be your man Please All my love I promise you all my love All the love I can give As long as we both shall live I'll give you all the soul I know that your heart can hold Love that I feel inside for you It's true I'd walk through burning sand Sail the ship on dry land If I could be your man I, I promise to be true I'll be real good to you I wanna be your man Please, yeah All my love I promise you all my love All the love I can give As long as we both shall live I'll give you all the soul I know that your heart can hold The love I feel inside for you Oh, it's true Darling, I'd walk through burning sand Sail the ship on dry land All I wanna do is just be your man Please, please, oh yeah All my love I promise you all my love All the love I can give As long as we both shall live I'll give you all the soul I know that your heart can hold All the love I can give As long as we both shall live"
Jazz,"You keep me hanging here
And you steal my time
While I wear my heart out on my sleeve,
Oh, on my sleeve.

Me, I am falling down,
Come see me drown
Checking Out the bottles 
At the bar

Like to be away so far

Me, wonder will the wind blow?

Am I chasing snow, though I'll never show
My sorrow's face, my sorrow's face?

Oh you, do you have to toy with
A bolted chest in my mind's chaotic
Lumber room, rattling on fair fortune's loom?"
Jazz,"I was just minding my business
Life was a beautiful song
Didn't have a care nor worry
Then you had to come along
I fell in love with you first time
I looked into them there eyes
You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin'
With them there eyes
They make me feel happy, they make me blue
No stallin'
I'm fallin'
Going in a big way for sweet little you
My heart is jumpin'
You sure started somethin'
With them there eyes
You'd better watch them if you're wise
They sparkle, they bubble
They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble
You're overworkin' 'em
There's danger lurkin' in
Them there eyes
Maybe you think I'm just flirtin'
Maybe you think I'm all lies
Just because I get romantic when I gaze in
Them there eyes
I fell in love with you first time
I looked into them there eyes
You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin'
With them there eyes
They make me feel happy, they make me blue
No stallin'
I'm fallin'
Going in a big way for sweet little you
My heart is jumpin'
You sure started somethin'
With them there eyes
You'd better watch them if you're wise
They sparkle
They bubble
They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble
You're overworkin' 'em
There's danger lurkin' in
Them there eyes"
Jazz,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you."
Jazz,"Got my tweed pressed, got my best vest, all I need now is the girl
Got my striped tie, got my hopes high
Got the time and the place and I got the rhythm,
Now all I need's the girl to go with 'em

If she'll just appear we'll take this big town for a whirl
And if she'll say ""My, darling, I'm yours""
I'll throw away my striped tie and my best-pressed tweed
All I really need is the girl

Got my tweed pressed, I got my best vest, all I need now is the girl
Got my striped tie, got my hopes 'way up high
I got the time and the place and the rhythm
All I need's the girl to go with 'em

Mm, if she'll just appear we'll take this, this great big town for a whirl
And if, if she'll say ""My, darlin', I'm yours""
I'll throw away my striped tie and my best-pressed tweed
All I real, really need is the girl"
Jazz,"Summertime and the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high
Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'
So hush, little baby, don't you cry

One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing
And you'll spread your wings and you'll take to the sky
But till that morning there ain't nothin' can harm you
With daddy and mammy standin' by

One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing
And you'll spread your wings and you'll take to the sky
But till that morning there ain't nothin' can harm you
With daddy and mammy standin' by"
Jazz,"Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
 
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay

From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now"
Jazz,"Já é demais
Tanta caridade
E não se pode
Transitar pela cidade
Segunda-feira é do repolho
Terça-feira do abacate
Quarta-feira é da navita
Quinta-feira é do tomate
Sexta-feira elas preparam
Mais um golpe inteligente
E no sábado saem à rua
Raspando o bolso da gente
De todas as caridades
Que paga o povo lampeiro
O doente, o cego e o pobre
Do cobre só sente cheiro
Amanhã, dia do chifre
Da cabeça do demônio
Mais uma colheita gorda
Em benefício do Petrônio"

Jazz,"Close your eyes
Have no fear
The monster's gone
He's on the run and your daddy's here

Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy

Before you go to sleep
Say a little prayer
Every day in every way, it's getting better and better

Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy

Out on the ocean sailing away
I can hardly wait
To see you come of age
But I guess we'll both just have to be patient
'Cause it's a long way to go
A hard row to hoe
Yes, it's a long way to go
But in the meantime

Before you cross the street
Take my hand
Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans

Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy

Before you go to sleep
Say a little prayer
Every day in every way, it's getting better and better

Jazz,"Everyday you're walkin' by
And I can see
How you shine
Here I am alone with nothin'
But a dream
That you are mine
Just exactly what I'll do
I don't know baby
But I gotta find
A way to reach you

Tell me what I gotta do
To get to your house
Tell me where I gotta go
To be with you
Tell me what I gotta say
To speak to your heart
Tell me what I need
To know tonight
So everything will be all right

Every night I wonder
Just how it would feel
Close to you
I imagine that this
Fantasy is real
You love me too
Got to get from here to there
Here and now baby
Open up your arms
And let me love you

Tell me what I gotta do
To get to your house
Tell me where I gotta go
To be with you
Tell me what I gotta say
To speak to your heart
Tell me what I need
To know tonight
So everything will be all right

Got to get from here
To there
Here and now baby
Open up your arms
And let me love you

Tell me what I gotta do
To get to your house
Tell me where I gotta go
To be with you
Tell me what I gotta say
To speak to your heart
Tell me what I need
To know tonight
So everything will be all right"
Jazz,"You see this girl, this girl's in love with you
Yes, I'm in love, who looks at you the way I do?
When you smile I can tell we know each other very well
How can I show you that I'm glad I got to know you?

Cause I've heard some talk, they say you think I'm fine
This girl's in love and what I'd do to make you mine?
Tell me now is it so? Don't let me be the last to know
My hands are shaking, don't let my heart keep breaking

Cause I need your love, I want your love
Say you're in love and you'll be my guy
If not I'll just die

Tell me now is it so? Don't let me be the last to know
My hands are shaking, don't let my heart keep breaking

Cause I need your love, I want your love
Say you're in love and you'll be my guy
If not I'll just die"
Jazz,"Time and again I've longed for adventure,
Something to make my heart beat the faster.
What did I long for? I never really knew.
Finding your love I've found my adventure,
Touching your hand, my heart beats the faster,
All that I want in all of this world is you.

You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long.
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.

You are the angel glow that lights a star,
The dearest things I know are what you are.
Some day my happy arms will hold you,
And some day I'll know that moment divine,
When all the things you are, are mine!"
Jazz,"I don't know why but I'm feeling so sad I long to try something I never had Never had no kissin' Oh, what I've been missin' Lover man, oh, where can you be? The night is cold and I'm so alone I'd give my soul just to call you my own Got a moon above me But no one to love me Lover man, oh, where can you be? I've heard it said That the thrill of romance Can be like a heavenly dream I go to bed with a prayer That you'll make love to me Strange as it seems Someday we'll meet And you'll dry all my tears Then whisper sweet Little things in my ear Hugging and a-kissing Oh, what I've been missing Lover man, oh, where can you be?"
Jazz,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love"
Jazz,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring"
Jazz,"I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy, but I wanna go outside in the rain

I'm crying because of you
Let me go, let me go, let me go

Once the rain starts falling, baby
You won't find a trace
I'm crying because of you
Let me go, let me go, let me go

I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy, but I wanna go outside in the rain

I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy, but I wanna go outside in the rain

I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy, but I wanna go outside in the rain"
Jazz,"Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep little darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep little darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you will rise
Sleep little darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Boy you gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight in a long time

Golden Slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you will rise
Sleep little darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Boy you gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight in a long time"
Jazz,"What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love
Who can solve it's mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?

I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw it away
That's why I ask the Lord above
What is this thing called love?

I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw it away
That's why I ask the Lord above
What is this thing called love?"
Jazz,"Hello central, give me Doctor Jazz
He's got what I need, I'll say he has
When the world goes wrong and I've got the blues
He's the guy who makes me put on both my dancin' shoes

The more I get, the more I want, it seems
I page Doctor Jazz in all my dreams
When I'm trouble-bound and mixed
He's the guy who gets me fixed
Hello central give me Doctor Jazz"
Jazz,"Who cares if the sky cares
To fall in the sea?
Who cares what banks fail in Yonkers,
Long as you've got a kiss that conquers?

Why should I care?
Life is one long jubilee,
So long as I care for you
And you care for me!"
Jazz,"Pennsylvania, six, five-thousand
Pennsylvania, six, five-thousand
Pennsylvania, six, five-thousand

Pennsylvania, six, five-oh-oh-oh"
Jazz,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon."
Jazz,"I may get along, when love is gone
Still, you made your mark, here in my heart

One day I'll fly away
Leave your love to yesterday
What more can your love do for me?
When will love be through with me?

I follow the night
Can't stand the light
When will will I begin
My life again?

One day I'll fly away
Leave your love to yesterday
What more can your love do fot me?
When will love be through with me?
Why live life from dream to dream
And dread the day when dreaming ends"
Jazz,"New York, New York, or a village in Iowa

The only difference is the name

If you're alone, whether on Main Street, or on Broadway

If you're alone, they are both the same, a town's a lonely  town

When you pass through and there is no one waiting there for you

Then it's a lonely town, you wander up and down

The crowds rush by, a million faces pass before your eyes, still it's a lonely town

Unless there's love, a love that's shining

Like a harbor light, you're lost in the night

Unless there's love, the world's an empty place

And every town's a lonely town
"
Jazz,"There's a new girl in my neighborhood She's a sweet little thing, she looks real good She gets everybody's attention around They call her sweet little mama All the boys wink when they see her Even the girls smile when they meet her Everybody's trying to be first To hold sweet little mama She got a certain secret in her smile That makes you want to stay awhile But the minute you get too close She bursts out with a loud, loud cry Stop by my house and you can't miss her This little girl is my little sister She's about nine days old They call her sweet little mama Say she got a certain secret in her smile That makes you want to stay awhile The minute you get too close She bursts out with a loud, loud cry Stop by my house, you can't miss her This little girl is my little sister Well, she's about 9 days old They call her sweet little mama"
Jazz,"It brings a tear,
Into my eyes,
When I begin,
To realize,
I've cried so much,
Since you've been gone,
I guess I'm drowning in my own tears,

I sit and cry,
Just like a child
My pouring tears
Are runnin' wild
If you don't think
You'll be home soon
I guess I'll drown in my own tears

I know it's true
Into each life
Some rain, rain must pour
I'm so blue
Here without you
It keeps raining
More and more

Why don't you
Come on home
Oh yes so I won't
Be all alone
If you don't think
You'll be home soon

I guess I'll
(Drown in my own tears)
Ooh, don't let me
(Drown in my own tears)
When I'm in trouble, baby
(Drown in my own tears)
Oh, yeah, baby don't let me
(Drown in my own tears)
I guess I'll drown in my own tears
Oh, mmmmm."
Jazz,"Oh, how am I to know if it's really love that found its way here,
Oh, how am I to know, will it linger on, and leave me there.
I dare not guess at this strange happiness
Oh, how am I to know, can it be that love has come to stay here,"
Jazz,"Look out the window when that rain storm I let the wind blow up a brain storm And now I'm wondering Whether weather like this gets you too It may go on like this for hours Too late in fall for April showers So what we got here, got a thought or two I need to share with you, here goes Darling, tell me now Have I done wrong somehow That you won't look at me Need it pointed out Can't keep my wits about When you won't look at me Is there something I oughta know? You're finding hard to say Well, there's just a trace Hiding on your face And I've learned it that way Just another soul That really knows my soul And you won't look at me Does that take the prize? How much I love those eyes And they won't look at me Now the rain has gone But something lingers on There's certain sadness here Now that the sky is clear And it's so, so clear Yes, it's all so clear to me now And I can't help but fear That certain sadness here to stay"
Jazz,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
How high is the sky?"
Jazz,"Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always,
'Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday.

Now all you men's the same
But now I'm old enough to change my name.
Lord, that sun's gonna shine in my back door someday.

I'm gonna lay my head
On that lonesome railroad line
And let the 2:19 ease my troubled mind.

Trouble in mind, I'm blue,
But I won't be blue always.
Child, that wind's gonna come and blow my blues away!

"
Jazz,"Listen to my tale of woe
It's terribly sad, but true
All dressed up, no place to go
Each evening I'm awfully blue

I must win some handsome guy
Can't go on like this
I could blossom out I know
With somebody just like you, so

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good
Oh, lady, be good to me
I am so awfully misunderstood
So, lady, be good to me

Oh, please, have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood
So, lady, be good to me

Oh, please, have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood
So, lady, be good to me
Oh, lady, be good to me"
Jazz,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!"
Jazz,All the snow has turned to water Christmas days have come and gone Broken toys and faded colors Are all that's left to linger on I hate graveyards and old pawn shops For they always bring me tears I can't forgive the way they rob me Of my childhood souvenirs [Chorus] Memories they can't be boughten They can't be won at carnivals for free Well it took me years To get those souvenirs And I don't know how they slipped away from me Broken hearts and dirty windows Make life difficult to see That's why last night and this mornin' Always look the same to me I hate reading old love letters For they always bring me tears I can't forgive the way they rob me Of my sweetheart's souvenirs
Jazz,"Call all your friends
There's gonna be a party
And the band is gonna play

Once every year
The time is finally here
We're celebrating Independence Day

By the dawn's early light
We'll make a toast to party the most

The party never ends

Jazz,"Go, tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go, tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

While shepherds kept their watching
Over silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light

Go, tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go, tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

The shepherds feared and trembled
When lo! above the earth
Rang out the angels chorus
That hailed the Savior's birth

Go, tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go, tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

Down in a lowly manger
The humble Christ was born
And God sent us salvation
That blessed Christmas morn

Go, tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go, tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born."
Jazz,"Taking stock of what I have and what I haven't
What do I find? The things I got will keep me satisfied
Checking up on what I have and what I haven't
What do I find? A healthy balance on the credit side

Got no diamonds, got no pearls
Still I think I'm a lucky girl
I've got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
Got no mansion, got no yacht
Still I'm happy with what I've got
I've got the sun in the morning and the moon at night

Sunshine gives me a lovely day
Moonlight gives me the Milky Way
Got no check books, got no banks
Still I'd like to express my thanks
I've got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
And with the sun in the morning and the moon in the evening
I'm all right

De-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

De-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

Sunshine gives me a lovely day
Moonlight gives me the Milky Way
Got no check books, got no banks
Still I'd like to express my thanks
I've got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
And with the sun in the morning, moon in the evening
I'm doing all right
Doing all right
Doing all right
I'm doing all right"
Jazz,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you."
Jazz,"""I'm the Sheik of Araby, 
Your love belongs to me.
At night when you're asleep 
Into your tent I'll creep.
The stars that shine above,
Will light our way to love.
You'll rule this land with me;"
Jazz,"Aphrodisia, Darling let me take you there.
Aphrodisia. Aphrodisia, Darling, let me take you there, 
Aphrodisia.
 
I never thought I'd ever get you here.
So, Baby, let's love before the moment disappears.
The fire's burnin', it's time for learning what turns us on.
When we're in motion, we'll keep going until the dawn.
Oh Girl understand I just want to be the man to give you what you need.
Just come along with me.
 
Aphrodisia Darling let me take you there.
Aphrodisia. Aphrodisia, Darling, let me take you there,

Eww, come here, Suga Let me taste your body now 
I'm hungry for your loving just let me show you how.
 
Aphrodisia Darling let me take you there.
Aphrodisia. Aphrodisia, Darling, let me take you there, 
Aphrodisia.
 
I've been opn your case for days
Girl, since I laid eyes on you I could see it in your face
You got those ""lack of lovin' blues""
You don't have to weep no longer ""Cause the Love Doctor"" is here
I got stuff to make ya holler let me be your souvenir
 
C'mon let me taste you, girl Let me get inside your world
I wanna take your mind somewhere, you best just be prepared

Let me ease your tension inside places I won't mention
 
Aphrodisia Darling let me take you there.
Aphrodisia. Aphrodisia, Darling, let me take you there, 
Aphrodisia.

Jazz,"Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me

Say ""Night-ie night"" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries far behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me"
Jazz,"i'm through with love
it's only a madness

don't want anybody to call my own

takes over my heart
i feel like i'm losing control
these moments of weakness
allow me a glimpse of heaven
but i've been so strong
can it be true
it's like a mystery too soulful
for you broke my resolve

oh i have to comply
can no longer deny
that i could really go for you

it could be so good
i'm wishing anew

Jazz,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all"
Jazz,"Well I can't forget this evening
And your face when you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile
But in your eyes the sorrow shows
Yes it shows
No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think about my sorrow
I had you there, then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live
I can't live anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live
I can't live anymore
Well I can't forget this evening
And your face when you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile
But in your eyes the sorrow shows
Yes it shows
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live
I can't live anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live
I can't live anymore

Jazz,"In A Sentimental Mood 
I can see the stars come thru my room
While your loving attitude
Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my 
Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing 
Since you made me this night a thing divine
In A Sentimental Mood 
I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt 
That you'd be loving sentimental me
In A Sentimental Mood 
I can see the stars come thru my room
While your loving attitude 
Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet

For I never dreamt 
That you'd be loving sentimental me"

Even the owl tells me you're foul singing those lullaby notes

"
Jazz,"And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear,
I'll state my case of which I'm certain.

I've lived a life that's full,
I travelled each and every highway,
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Regrets, I've had a few,
But then again too few to mention
Did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
Planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it My Way.

I've loved,
I've laughed and cried,
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way

Oh no, oh no not me
I did it My Way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught. 
To say the things he truly feels; 
And not the words of one who kneels. 
The record shows 
I took the blows 
And did it my way!"
Jazz,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight."
Jazz,"Feels so real, my mind won't let go
Feels so real, my mind won't let go

It is a night, I won't forget
The kind you dream of 
Sweet candle light, the mood is set
I'm ready for more
Your kiss, sweet embrace
I'll never be the same
Are you my dream come true
You just feel me so, won't let go

Feels so real, my mind won't let go
Is this my dream come true
Feels so real, my mind won't let go
Feels so real, my mind won't let go
No matter what I do
Feels so real, my mind won't let go

So close to you and yet so far
It tears me apart
I'm wishing you my happiness
Is there where you are

For you I'll be ture
and it will be insane
we kiss on a night like this
Love will surely grow
don't let it go

Feels so real, my mind won't let go
Is this my dream come true
Feels so real, my mind won't let go
No matter what I do
Feels so real, my mind won't let go
Whoa-oh
Feels so real, my mind won't let go

Baby love,just the two of us
Making love
Does it seem that love is just a dream
Give it up
Baby love, just the two of us
Making love
Feels so real
Does it seem that love is just a dream
Give it up
My love is coming on strong"

Jazz,"CHORUS I can love again More than a sentimental feeling I hold within With a heart full of compassion You took me in You're my closest friend, I can love again A smile would hide my pain I'd have to laugh to keep from shedding a tear The sting of a promise broken, a needy word unspoken Helped turn my pain to fear But there You were for me Helped to ease the pain that caused me agony Can't help but to wonder Why You pulled me from under But it feels so good within, I can love again CHORUS No one could see What my foolish pride had done to me Caused me to ignore All the love that was in store That was in store for me It's because of You Pride has passed away Your love revealed what was true All the love within Caused this broken heart to mend Your love I want to commend Everybody, I can love again CHORUS * CHORUS * BRIDGE Life is worth living again Since You gave me joy and peace down within So good to know I'm loved for sure Fear no longer lives within, I can love again CHORUS * REPEAT"
Jazz,"Autumn in New York
Why does it seem so inviting
Autumn in New York
It spells the thrill of first-knighting

Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds
In canyons of steel
They're making me feel
I'm home

It's autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love
Autumn in New York
Is often mingled with pain

Dreamers with empty hands
And they sigh for exotic lands
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again

This autumn in New York
Transforms the slums into Mayfair
Autumn in New York
You'll need no castles in Spain

Lovers that bless the dark
On benches in Central Park
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again"
Jazz,"You've got to accentuate the positive
Eliminate the negative
Latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister in-between

You've got to spread joy up to the maximum
Bring gloom down to the minimum
Have faith or pandemonium
Liable to walk upon the scene

To illustrate his last remark
Jonah in the whale, noah in the ark
What did they do
Just when everything looked so dark

Man, they said we better, accentuate the positive
Eliminate the negative
Latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister in-between
No, do not mess with mister in-between
Do you hear me?

Oh, listen to me children and-a you will hear
About the elininatin' of the negative
And the accent on the positive
And gather 'round me children if you're willin'
And sit tight while I start reviewin'
The attitude of doin' right

You've gotta accentuate the positive
Eliminate the negative
Latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister in-between

You've got to spread joy up to the maximum
Bring gloom, down to the minimum
Otherwise pandemonium
Liable to walk upon the scene

To illustrate my last remark
Jonah in the whale, noah in the ark
What did they say
Say when everything looked so dark

Man, they said we better accentuate the positive
Eliminate the negative
Latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister in-between
No, don't mess with mister in-between"
Jazz,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss"
Jazz,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me."

""Baba, daba, daba, daba, daba, daba, dab""
Said the Monkey to the Chimp
All night long they'd chatter away
All day long they're happy and gay
Swinging and singing in their hunky, tonkey way
""Aba, daba, daba, daba, daba, daba, dab""
Means ""Monk, I love but you""
""Baba, daba, dab,"" in monkey talk
Means ""Chimp, I love you too""
Then the big baboon, one night in June
He married them, and very soon 
They went upon their aba, daba honeymoon

Jazz,"Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to make romance
Neath the cover of October skies
And all the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
And I'm trying to please to the calling
Of your heart-strings that play soft and low
And all the nights magic seems to whisper and hush
And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush

[Chorus]
Can I just have one a more moondance with you, my love
Can I just make some more romance with a-you, my love

Well, I wanna make love to you tonight
I can't wait 'til the morning has come
And I know that the time is just right
And straight into my arms you will run
And when you come my heart will be waiting
To make sure that you're never alone
There and then all my dreams will come true, dear
There and then I will make you my own
And every time I touch you, you just tremble inside
And I know how much you want me that you can't hide

[Chorus]

Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to make romance
Neath the cover of October skies
And all the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
And I'm trying to please to the calling
Of your heart-strings that play soft and low
And all the nights magic seems to whisper and hush
And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush

One more moondance with you in the moonlight
On a magic night
La, la, la, la in the moonlight
On a magic night
Can't I just have one more dance with you my love"
Jazz,"It's not the pale moon that excites me 
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you"
Jazz,"You're a no good heart breaker
You're a liar and you're a cheat
And I don't know why
I let you do these things to me
My friends keep telling me
That you ain't no good
But oh, they don't know
That I'd leave you if I could

I guess I'm uptight
And I'm stuck like glue
Cause I ain't never
I ain't never, I ain't never, no, no (loved a man)
(The way that I, I love you)

Some time ago I thought
You had run out of fools
But I was so wrong
You got one that you'll never lose
The way you treat me is a shame
How could ya hurt me so bad
Baby, you know that I'm the best thing
That you ever had
Kiss me once again

Don't ya never, never say that we we're through
Cause I ain't never
Never, Never, no, no (loved a man)
(The way that I, I love you)

I can't sleep at night
And I can't even fight
I guess I'll never be free
Since you got, your hooks, in me

Whoa, oh, oh
Yeah! Yeah!
I ain't never loved a man
I ain't never loved a man, baby
Ain't never had a man hurt me so bad

No
Well this is what I'm gonna do about it"
Jazz,"Just you, just me
Let's find a cozy spot
To cuddle and coo
 
Just us, just we
I've missed an awful lot
My trouble is you
 
Oh, gee!
What are your charms for?
What are my arms for?
Use your imagination!
Just you, just me
I'll tie a lover's knot
'Round wonderful you!"
Jazz,"Why should I feel discouraged?
And why should the shadows come?
Why should my heart be lonely
And long for Heaven and home?

When Jesus is my captain
My constant friend is He
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me

I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
Oh, His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
He watches me

"
Jazz,"You're irresponsible, no focus
I hold this advice script
I ripped it to shreds I was headed
With sound waves and frequencies
Frequently I'm freakin the flows like hoes
And assholes so rub-a-dub those
Shattering Glass Joes with decibels
To break spectacles, you can't see
You're feelin' queezy and uneasy
Steppin cautious because you're nauseous
I squashes emcees like I was Colossus
Flippin on Magneto, never metal, without my bending
Ending all existance, my rhymes blending
Niggas up and liquifying, punks are crying
Crews are dying while the mack keeps shining
Gleaming, girls are screaming, cuz I'm arousing
My styles bring, ___ kids, so how you look? Ya drowning
And drained. Refrain from being slain
By my slang, once again I wreck brains

Yo, shit occurs when I shift my words
I dip a Swisher, to my kisser
And get spliffed-a, I riff the
Be the Mista, the abyss the
Widen, cuz I slide in
Like a titan, mythical
When I grip or pull
Spliff, it will manipulate my brain
In ways to plot or gain
And raises
Tajai is the brand that
Keep it jam-packed
Frankly- pretty damn phat
It's over me, I am enough to rip it flat, and pass
The mic to me and see emcees sadden fast
You're ratty, match my tip, you pips
And Gladyss Knight gets darkness
Is where we best start, kids
If ours gets bootlegged and sold in the market
Then mark this
Them stands plan to be targets
And I'll stand grand
Then peace to Richmond and
Of course the Land
I'm lettin ya know cuz I can

""Yeah, I'mma let ya know
Yeah, I'mma let ya know
Yeah, I let you know
Yo, I'm lettin niggas know""

I say that nigga A
That nigga A-K
Can make a nigga day
In a very special nigga way
Breaking backs and fists
As I smack and dis
Wackness
Cuz they lack this
Phatness
In fact this is
Very booty indeed
Prayin you could be freed
From torture
Or I'll scorch ya
With a torch ya, gasoline
I smash your spleen
I'm quick to blast a fiend
You betta jet if ya' ass is keen
Yeah, I got a masta plan
I'm fasta than
Drastic Man
My thing is ""Who would blast a friend?""
I only blast wack rhymas
It's time to find ya' own flows
I throw spines and bones
Your ass
Extremely ass
You see me pass
The senior class
Yo- and now I'm free at last
So let me bust a grill if I must
Making blood spill and your eyes fill with puss
When I bust

Here I go again
Return of the Jedi, red eye
Use my lightsaber to take guys that pick my flavor
I pounce and trounce on emcees when I slay ya
Remember the days
You parleys 'em to the left
Cuz I get deffer
Than senior citizens with Alzheimer's
And squash rhymas to vapor
Shatter- at a
Forfeitcha when I splitcha
Tore and ripped ya
My oratore's quick ta
Concoct a sicka- flow
So crawl back under your rock
Get off my jock
I'm quicka than minute rice
To split and slice
Rappaz as I entrapped ya
Slapped ya, with my rapture
On the down low, I trapped your brain
And flips it
Watch the maestro
Slice hoz, entice hoz
As I rip shit
Dip shit, you rap but
Keep your trap shut
Cuz you lack what
Phesto's inducing
I get mood swings!"
Jazz,"Maybe it was the music
Or the glamorous sky of blue
Maybe it was the mood I was in
Or maybe it was really you, really you

This heart of mine was doing very well
The world was fine as far as i could tell
And then quite suddenly i saw you, and i dreamed of gay amours
At dawn i wake up singing sentimental overtures

This heart of mine is gaily dancing now
I taste the wine of real romancing now
Somehow this crazy world has taken on a wonderful design
As long as life endures, it's yours, this heart of mine"
Jazz,"Talking by the pool of light, language from America.
She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd
They are not a melting pot, say no, say no tapestry
She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd

She takes his hand and she says you'll stay
She's lost in the crowd
King
Wire them up, fire them up
The life and times, the art and talk
Wire them up, fire them up
The life and times, the art and talk

Lovers run camp Africa, Bars in town are civilised
She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd
Panorama, Citylife
Youth's dance proud from the waist down
She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd

Shot from where the action is, a rhapsody in black and blue
She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd
Love lies under western eyes, powerful yet transient
She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd
"
Jazz,"You, get me feelin' crazy
There always on my mind
And I get to feelin' lately
If I never knew your name,
I'd love you all the same
But I have you to myself
Wanting nothing else
Knowing that you're mine

Good time,bad time,all the time
Hands reachin' 'cross a room
And I know somewhere inside my mind
If I never knew your name,
I'd love you all the same,
But I have you to myself
Wanting nothing else
Knowing that you're mine

Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba

And I know somewhere inside my mind
If I never knew your name,
I'd love you all the same
But I have you to myself

Wanting nothing else
Knowing that you're mine
Have you to myself
Wanting nothing else
Knowing that you're mine..."
Jazz,"Sometimes in the morning, when shadows are deep, 
I lie here beside you, just watching you sleep, 
And sometimes I whisper, what I`m thinking of, 
My cup runneth over with love . . . 
 
Sometimes in the evening, when you do not see, 
I study the small things, you do constantly, 
I memorize moments, that I`m fondest of, 
My cup runneth over with love . . . 
 
In only a moment, we both will be old, 
We won`t even notice the world turning cold. 
And so, in this moment, with sunlight above, 
My cup runneth over with love . . . 
 
With love . . ."
Jazz,"It's the wrong time and the wrong place
Though your face is charming it's the wrong face
It's not his face but it's such a charming face
Ooh, it's alright with me

It's the wrong song with the wrong style
Though your smile is lovely it's the wrong smile
It's not his smile but it's such a lovely smile
And ooh, that's alright with me

You can't know how happy I was that we met
I'm strangely attracted to you
There's someone I'm trying so hard to forget
Oh baby, don't you wanna forget somebody too?

It's the wrong game with the wrong chips
Though your lips are tempting they're the wrong lips
They're not his lips but they're such tempting lips
And ooh, that's alright with me

You can't know how happy I was that we met
I'm strangely attracted to you
There's someone I'm trying so hard to forget
Oh baby, don't you wanna forget somebody too?

It's the wrong name with the wrong chips
Though your lips are tempting they're the wrong lips
They're not his lips but they're such tempting lips
Here it's alright if it feels right maybe all night
Ooh, it's alright, it's quite alright with me

"
Jazz,"Just you, just me
Let's find a cozy spot

Just us, just we

My trouble is you
 
Oh, gee!
What are your charms for?
What are my arms for?
Use your imagination!
Just you, just me
I'll tie a lover's knot
'Round wonderful you!"
Jazz,"Where am I going? Makes no difference to me Where am I going? It don't matter to me Yellow leaves fall all around me In wonderful decay Shed no tears for dry dead flowers Let them fall where they may Where am I going? Makes no difference to me Where am I going? It don't matter to me Like a circus ride, spinnin' around I'm a careless boy But now I feel all right To let go and just hang around She takes Cindy Sherman pictures And she cuts herself She says,"
Jazz,"Some other spring
I'll try to love
Now I still cling
To faded blossoms
Fresh from worn
Left crushed and torn
Like the love affair I mourn

Some other spring
When twilight falls
Will the night bring
Another to me

Not your kind
But let me find
It's not true that love is blind
Sunshine's around me
But deep in my heart
It's cold as ice
Love, once you've found me
But can that story unfold twice

Some other spring
Will my heart awake
Stirring to sing
Love's magic music
Then forget the old duet
And love in some other spring

Sunshine's around me
But deep in my heart
It's cold as ice
Love, once you've found me
But can that story be told twice

Some other spring
Will my heart awake
Stirring to sing
Love's magic music
Then forget the old duet
And love in some other spring"
Jazz,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me
You and you alone
Bring out the Gypsy in me

I love all the many charms about you
Above all, I want my arms about you

Don't be a naughty baby
Come to mama, come to mama do
My sweet embraceable you

I love all the many charms about you
Above all, I want my arms about you

Don't be a naughty baby
Come to mama, come to mama do
My sweet embraceable you"
Jazz,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try"
Jazz,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me."
Jazz,"All that time I was searching, nowhere to run to, it started me thinking,
Wondering what I could make of my life, who'd be waiting,
Asking all kinds of questions, to myself, but never finding the answers,
Crying at the top of my voice, no one listening,
All this time, I still remember everything you said
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget.

Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.

So listen, listen to me,
You must believe me,
I can feel your eyes go through me,
But I don't know why.

I know you're going, but I can't believe it's the way that you're leaving,
It's like we never knew each other at all, it may be my fault,
I gave you too many reasons, being alone, when I didn't want to
I thought you'd always be there, I almost believed you,
All this time, I still remember everything you said,
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget.

Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.

So listen, listen to me,
I can feel your eyes go through me

It seems I've spent too long
Only thinking about myself
Now I want to spend my life
Just caring bout somebody else.

Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep."

He's the craziest, like young

He drinks coffee at Cafe Espresso
He reads Kerouac, like young
He goes where all the angry young men go
Recites poetry, like young

And we're homin' it, like now
We spin records on cloud number seven
And he's reachin' me, like wow

A dreamy view, just we two alone
If love in Dreamsville, time is new
We're here to love and we do

We can see the rest of the world
Below us from our pink cloud

There's no boundary to this magic land
As we go exploring hand in hand

The things you think
Come from the dream
You dream
Thought has wings

Are seldom
What they seem

Sometimes you think
You've lived before
All that you
Live to day
Things you do
Come back to you
As though
They knew the way

Oh the tricks
Your mind can play

It seems we stood
And talked
Like this before
We looked
At each other
In the same way
Then but I
Can't remember
Where or when

The clothes
You're wearing
Are the close
You wore
The smile
You are smiling
You were
Smiling then
But I
Can't remember
Where or when

Some things
That happened
For the
First time
Seem to be
Happening again

And so it seems
That we have
Met before
And that we
Laughed before
Also loved before
But who knows
Where or when"
Jazz,"The summer wind
Came blowing in
From across the sea
It lingered there
So warm and fair
To walk with me
All summer long
We sang a song
And strolled on golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind

Like painted kites
Those days and nights
Went flyin' by
The world was new
Beneath a blue
Umbrella sky
Then softer than
A piper man
One day it called to you
And I lost you
To the summer wind

The autumn wind
And the winter wind
Have come and gone
And still the days
Those lonely days
Go on and on
And guess who sighs her lullabies
Through nights that never end
My fickle friend
The summer wind
The summer wind"
Jazz,"Strange
How a dreary world can suddenly change
To a world as bright as the evening star
Queer
What a difference when your vision is clear
And you see things as they really are

I used to be color-blind
But I met you and now I find
There's green in the grass
There's gold in the moon
There's blue in the skies

That semi-circle that was always hanging about
Is not a storm cloud, it's a rainbow
And you brought the colors out

Believe me it's really true
Till I met you I never knew
A setting sun could paint such beautiful skies

I never knew there were such lovely colors
And the big surprise
Is the red in your cheeks
The gold in your hair
The blue in your eyes"
Jazz,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I pine, for you dear only
Why haven`t you seen it?
I`m all for you, body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it`s me you`re wronging
I tell you I mean it
I`m all for you, body and soul

I can`t believe it, it`s hard to conceive it
That you`d turn away romance.
Are you pretending? It looks like the ending 
Unless I can have
Just one more chance, dear

My life a wreck you`re making
My heart is yours for just the taking
I`ll gladly surrender
Myself to you, body and soul"
Jazz,"I was a stranger in the city  
Out of town were the people I knew  
I had that feeling of self-pity  
What to do? What to do? What to do?  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London Town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The British Museum had lost its charm  
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?  
But the age of miracles hadn't passed,  
For, suddenly, I saw you there 
And through foggy London Town  
The sun was shining everywhere."
Jazz,"Turning into something I can't cope
With not having
Stop, stop it
Could I put my hands up

And ask that you stop
Do I need to be in love
I'm lost when it's just me
With only a hope to make

You happy enough to stay
Return the words, the looks
I give you like they're falling out of me
Seconds change

And at the end
Your face is inerasable
True, I need to be in love
I'm lost when it's just me

With only a hope to make
You happy enough
Do I need to be in love
What is there otherwise from loving

Just takes a face
To make everything else erase
Stop, stop it
Could I put my hands up
And ask that you stop"
Jazz,"That's my baby
No sir, I don't mean maybe
Yes sir, that's my baby now

Yes, ma'm, we've decided
No ma'm, we ain't gonna hide it
Yes, ma'm, you're invited now

By the way, by the way
When we walk up to the preacher I'll say

Yes sir, that's my baby
No sir, I don't mean maybe
Yes sir, that's my baby now

By the way, by the way
When we run into the preacher I'll say

I'll say yes sir, that's my baby
No sir, I don't mean maybe
Yes sir, that's my baby now

Mmm

"
Jazz,"It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.
For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still,
It had to be you, wonderful you,
It had to be you.

It had to be you, it had to be you.

Jazz,"Honey, honey, 
Oh, honey, listen to my plea: 

Every honeybee 
Fills with jealousy, 
When they see you out with me! 
I don't blame them, goodness knows, 
Oh, honey! suckle rose! 

When you're passin' by, 
Flowers droop and sigh 
And I know the reason why, 
You're my sweety, goodness knows, 
Oh, honey! suckle rose! 

I don't buy sugar, 
You just have to touch my cup; 
I don't need sugar, 
It's sweet enough when you stir it up! 
When I'm taking sips 
From your dainty lips, 
Seems the honey fairly drips, 
You're confection, goodness knows, 
Oh, honey! suckle rose.

Jazz,"he will not always say
what you would have him say
but now and then he'll say something wonderful

the thoughtless things he'll do
will hurt and worry you
then all at once he'll do
something wonderful



He has a thousand dreams 
That won't come true, 
You know that he believes in them 
And that's enough for you. 

You'll always go along, 
Defend him where he's wrong 
And tell him, when he's strong 
He is 
Wonderful 
He'll always 
Needs your love 
And so he'll get your love. 
A man who needs your love 
Can be 
Wonderful. 

She'll always go along 
Defend him when he's wrong 
And tell him when he's strong 
He is wonderful. 
He'll always need her love

Can be wonderful.


"
Jazz,"How come you do me like you do do do?
How come you do me like you do?
Why do you try to make me feel so blue?
I've done nothing to you.
Do me right or else just let me be.
'Cause I can beat you doing what you're doing to me.
How come you do me like you do do do?
How come you do me like you do?
"
Jazz,"I don't know why but I'm feeling so sad
I long to try something I never had
Never had no kissing
Oh, what I've been missing
Lover man, oh, where can you be

The night is cold and I'm so alone
I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me
But no one to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be

I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
Then whisper sweet
Little things in my ear
Hugging and a kissing
Oh, what we've been missing
Lover man, oh, where can you be

I've heard it said

Jazz,"The song a robin sings,
Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at evening tides.
That ripples through a nook where two lovers hide.

That great symphonic theme,
That's Stella by starlight,
And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
She's everything on this earth to me.

Jazz,"We met at nine, we met at eight, I was on time, no, you were late
Ah, yes, I remember it well
We dined with friends, we dined alone, a tenor sang, a baritone
Ah, yes, I remember it well

That dazzling April moon, there was none that night
And the month was June, that's right, that's right
It warms my heart to know that you remember still the way you do
Ah, yes, I remember it well

How often I've thought of that Friday, Monday night
When we had our last rendezvous
And somehow I foolishly wondered if you might
By some chance be thinking of it too?

That carriage ride, you walked me home
You lost a glove, aha, it was a comb
Ah, yes, I remember it well
That brilliant sky, we had some rain
Those Russian songs from sunny Spain
Ah, yes, I remember it well

You wore a gown of gold, I was all in blue
Am I getting old? Oh, no, not you
How strong you were, how young and gay
A prince of love in every way
Ah, yes, I remember it well"
Jazz,"Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm

If you should go away, I have today
Won't you stay?
You're the one with the key to my heart
You taught me many things are giving here
We were near-ear-ear
The one with the key to my heart

Never could be (Never could be)
Someone like you to understand (To understand)
All the hurt and pain, you're my only man
My love is yours at your command

Listen, at night I think of you, how we grew
Now I'm blue-ue-ue
The one with the key to my heart 
Together we share the world, a string of pearls
I was your girl
You're the one with the key of my heart

You unlock the door (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
To all of the years that a part of me
I hope you'll see that you made me free
Now that you're gone (Now that you're gone)

Jazz,"(Billie Holiday)

When I hear them say
There's better living
Let them go their way
To that new living
I won't ever stray
'Cause this is heaven to me

Long as freedom grows
I want to seek it
If it's yes or no
It's me who'll speak it
'Cause the lord, He knows
That this is heaven to me

If you've got your hands
And got your feet
To sing your song
All through the street
You raise your head
When night is done
Shout your thanks up to the sun

So when I hear them say
There's better living
Let them go their way
To that new living
I won't ever stray
'Cause this is heaven to me




"
Jazz,"What's it all about, Alfie?
Is it just for the moment we live?
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?
Are we meant to take more than we give or are we meant to be kind?

And if only fools are kind, Alfie,
Then I guess it's wise to be cruel.
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie,
What will you lend on an old golden rule?

As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie,
I know there's something much more,
Something even non-believers can believe in.
I believe in love, Alfie.

Without true love we just exist, Alfie.
Until you find the love you've missed you're nothing, Alfie.
When you walk let your heart lead the way
And you'll find love any day, Alfie, Alfie."
Jazz,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here"
Jazz,"Up a lazy river by the old mill run
Lazy river in the noon day sun
You can linger a while in the shade of a tree
Throw away your troubles, dream a dream of me

Up a lazy river where the robin's song
Greets the mornin' as we roll along
There'll be blue skies above, everyone's in love
Up a lazy river how happy we'll be
Up a lazy river with me

Up a lazy river by the old mill run
There's a lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
You can linger for a while in the shade of a tree
Throw away your troubles baby, dream a dream of me

Up a lazy river where the robin's song
Greets the bright new mornin' where we can roll along
There may be blue skies up above, everyone's in love
Up a lazy river how happy we'll be
Up a lazy river with me

Up a lazy river where the robin's song
Greets a bright new mornin' where we can roll along
There may be blue skies up above but as long as we're in love
We'll be up a lazy river, up the crazy, lazy, river
Up a lazy river

I ain't goin' your way, get out of my way
Up a lazy river with me
"
Jazz,"You are my pride and joy
And I just love you, little darlin'
Like a baby boy loves his toy
You've got kisses sweeter than honey
And I work every day to give you all I know
And that's why you're my pride and joy

And I'm tellin' the world
You're my (pride and joy) pride and joy (pride and joy)
I believe I'm no (baby boy) baby boy (baby boy)
But I know you're mine (pride and joy)
My pride and joy (pride and joy)
Yeah baby (baby boy) Yeah baby (baby boy)

You, you are my pride and joy
And a love like mine, yeah baby
Is something nobody can ever destroy
You pick me up (pick me up) when I'm down (when I'm down)
And when we go out, pretty baby
You shake up the whole town (whole town)
And that's why (that's why)
I believe you're my (you're my) pride and joy (pride and joy)

Jazz,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Until it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
It's where you are
Somewhere there's heaven
How near, how far
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune

Jazz,"Let there be peace on earth
And let it begin with me
Let there be peace on earth
The peace that was meant to be
With God as our father
Brothers all are we
Let me walk with my brother
In perfect harmony

Let peace begin with me
Let this be the moment now
With every step I take
Let this be my solemn vow
To take each moment
And live each moment
To take each moment
And live each moment
To take each moment
And live each moment

Jazz,"I want to live, I want to give I've been a miner For a heart of gold. It's these expressions I never give That keep me searching For a heart of gold And I'm getting old. Keeps me searching For a heart of gold And I'm getting old. I've been to Hollywood I've been to Redwood I crossed the ocean For a heart of gold I've been in my mind, It's such a fine line That keeps me searching For a heart of gold And I'm getting old. Keeps me searching For a heart of gold And I'm getting old. Keep me searching For a heart of gold You keep me searching For a heart of gold And I'm getting old. I've been a miner For a heart of gold."
Jazz,"Of all the boys I've known, and I've known some Until I first met you, I was lonesome And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light And this old world seemed new to me You're really swell, I have to admit you Deserve expressions that really fit you And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain All the things that you do to me Bei mir bist du schÃ¶n, please let me explain Bei mir bist du schÃ¶n means you're grand Bei mir bist du schÃ¶n, again I'll explain It means you're the fairest in the land I could say ""Bella, Bella"", even say ""Wunderbar"" Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are I've tried to explain, bei mir bist du schÃ¶n So kiss me and say you understand Bei mir bist du schÃ¶n, you've heard it all before but let me try to explain Bei mir bist du schÃ¶n means that you're grand Bei mir bist du schÃ¶n, it's such an old refrain and yet I should explain It means I am begging for your hand"
Jazz,"Melancholy serenade every time I hear it played
Right out of space your haunting face appears

There were other serenades broken promises we made
Why must I pay day after day with tears

Alone in my room I watch the ghost of you
Alone in the gloom once more I'm close to you

Melancholy serenade as the music starts to fade
I feel your kiss and then you disappear

Alone in the gloom once more I'm close to you

Melancholy serenade as the music starts to fade
I feel your kiss and then you disappear"
Jazz,"Writer(s): antonio carlos jobim


Sky, so vast is the sky, with far away clouds just wandering by,
Where do they go? oh I don't know, don't know;
Wind that speaks to the leaves, telling stories that no one believes,
Stories of love belong to you and to me.

Oh, dindi, if I only had words I would say all the beautiful
Things that I see when you're with me, oh my dindi.
Oh dindi, like the song of the wind in the trees, that's how my heart is
Singing dindi, happy dindi, when you're with me.

I love you more each day, yes I do, yes I do;
I'd let you go away, if you take me with you.

Don't you know, dindi, I'd be running and searching for you like a river that
Can't find the sea, that would be me without you, my dindi.
Can't find the sea that would be me without you dindi.

Like a river that can't find the sea, that would be me without you, my dindi.

Jazz,"It had to be you, it had to be you
I wandered around, and finally found, the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me be blue
And even be glad, just to be sad thinking of you

Some others I've seen, might never be mean
Might never be cross, or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do
For nobody else, gave me a thrill, with all your faults, I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you
It had to be you

you was me we both blew so easlity

to let it show

keep falling thru
all my plans they became kkown to you depend on you
to help them grow
i love you and that's all i know

when the singer come let the song go on
it's a fine line between the darkness and the dawn
they say in the darkest night there's a light beyond

and the ending always comes 
when things always come too fast
they come too fast and pass too slow

Jazz,"You appear on the horizon far away
My desire to be there with you stirs the wind and fills the sense
In the bay I drop the anchor down swim ashore
On the beach the coconut palms, orchids, planchoniana and you

Your silent eyes convince me I'm your own
We're safe inside this agile blue lagoon

I want to know you bird of paradise
I want to show you of the love that I feel
I need to touch you bird of paradise
I need your touch to make this fantasy real

On the sea a storm is raging far away
And the ship like so many toys fear the wind and fight the waves
In your arms it's a forgotten dream, nothing more
Here the sky is perfectly clear, evening star the moonlight and you

Your silent eyes convince me I'm your own
We're safe inside this agile blue lagoon

I want to know you bird of paradise
I want to show you of the love that I feel
I need to touch you bird of paradise
I need your touch to make this fantasy real

Just you and me [Incomprehensible] of dreams
The bare necessities of love
My bird of paradise, I realize
But you were sent here from above
You're my bird of paradise
My bird of paradise

Just you and me [Incomprehensible] of dreams
The bare necessities of love
My bird of paradise, I realize

You're my bird of paradise

"
Jazz,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you"
Jazz,"Love, oh love, oh careless love
You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Night and day, I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone"
Jazz,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night

To think that spring had depended
On merely this a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung
When we were young last night

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung
When we were young last night
When we were young last night
Last night"

Jazz,"Ain't nothin' I can say, nothin' I can do,
I feel so bad, yeah, I feel so blue.
I got to make it right for everyone concerned
even if it's me, if it means it's me what's gettin' burned.

'Cause I could never make you unhappy, no, I couldn't do that girl,
only wish I didn't have to love you do, makes it so, so very hard to go.
(backgrounds-So very hard to go)
'Cause I love you so, (backgrounds answer-So  very hard to go),
ah, I love you do.

2nd Verse:  I knew the time would come,
I'd have to pay for my mistakes,
I can't blame you for what you're doin' to me girl,
even tho' my heart aches.
Your dreams have all come true just the way you planned them,
so I'll just  step aside, I'm gon step aside and lend a helping hand then.

'Cause I could never make you unhappy, no I couldn't do that girl,
only wish  I didn't love you so, makes it so, so very hard to go.
(Backgrounds-So very hard to go)
'Cause I love you so (backgrounds answer-so very hard to go)
Oh, I love you so (backgrounds answer again-so very hard to  go)
And it ain't easy to walk away when a man love some body (so very hard to  go) hey, hey, hey, hey."
Jazz,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream"
Jazz,"She makes it hard to guess, is it a yes?

Left my bet to ride, my hands are tied
Oh, to see inside
Take the world for a ride

Coming Out From Under stone,
You're not alone.

Playing solo, is it a no?

He's some fool and alright, 
What's done is done,
Pull out a plum,

Maybe I'll just cut and run..

Out From Under stone, 
You're not alone.

She needs no partner, disheartener.

I always came loaded, leaving light,
Aces all run dry, no longer eye to eye

Under a stone, you're not alone"
Jazz,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
On Green Dolphin Street
"
Jazz,"Thanks a million, a million thanks to you 
For everything that love could bring you brought me
Each tender love-word you happened to say
Is hidden away
In memory's bouquet
Thanks a million for I remember too 
The tenderness that your caresses taught me
You made a million dreams come true and so I'm saying
Thanks a million to you
 
Thanks a million, a million thanks to you 
For every thing that love could bring you brought me
Each tender love-word you happened to say
Is hidden away
In memory's bouquet
Thanks a million for I remember too 
The tenderness that your caresses taught me
You made a million dreams come true and so I'm saying
 Thanks a million to you
"
Jazz,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more 

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more"
Jazz,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Sweet child, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you"
Jazz,Picture a man of nearly thirty Who seems twice as old with clothes torn and dirty Give him a job shining shoes Or cleaning out toilets with bus station crews Give him six children with nothing to eat Expose them to life on a ghetto street Tie an old rag around his wife's head And have her pregnant and lying in bed Stuff them all in a Harlem house And then tell them how bad things are down South
Jazz,"Raindrops keep falling on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothin' seems to fit
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling

So I just did me some talkin' to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he' got things done
Sleepin' on the job
Those raindrops are falling on my, head they keep falling

But there's one thing I know
The blues he sends to meet me won't defeat me
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Crying's not for me
Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me"
Jazz,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known,
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you"
Jazz,"I'll meet you in the city
I'll pick you up at night
I'll drive you trough the suburbs
I'll get you there in time
I'll meet you in the city
I'll stay clear of the light
I'll get us through the checkpoints
Yeah, I know we'll be alright

Oh, Julian
Once we get across the border
Oh, Julian
I'll mend your heart
Oh, Julian
Once we get across the border
Oh, Julian
I'll mend your heart

And maybe we are sinners
But love, it ain't no crime
I'll get you through the checkpoints
I'll drive us through the night
You know I'll keep your secret
I've locked it up inside
As long as we are moving
Yeah, I know it'll be alright
Yeah, I know it'll be alright

Oh, Julian
Once we get across the border
Oh, Julian
I'll mend your heart
Oh, Julian
Once we get across the border
Oh, Julian
I'll mend your heart

Oh, Julian

Oh, Julian
I'll mend your heart
Oh, Julian
Once we get across the border
Oh, Julian
I'll mend your heart
Oh, Julian
Oh, Julian
I'll mend your heart"
Jazz,"The wind, the wind, the whistling wind A cowboy never rides alone When the trail seems long there's the friendly song The song of the wind, the whistling wind Where the wagon trains used to cross the plains There's always the wind, the whistling wind Whistling of the day of a long ago Of the buffalo and the Navajo Oh men like Daniel Boone and the settler too And the West that grew it's in the wind All in the wind, the whistling wind The whistling wind When shadows pale along the trail A cowboy never rides alone 'cause he rides again with the mighty men who ride in the wind The whistling wind When the shadows pale On the long, long trail There's always the wind, the whistling wind (The wind, the wind, the whistling wind) The wind, the wind, the whistling wind"
Jazz,"Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree

Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

It's phony it's plain to see
How happy I would be
If you believed in me"
Jazz,"I don't care what the weatherman says
When the weatherman says it's raining
You'll never hear me complaining
I'm certain the sun will shine

I don't care how the weather vane points
When the weather vane points to gloomy
It's gotta be sunny to me
When your eyes look into mine

Jeepers creepers, where'd ya get those peepers?
Jeepers creepers, where'd ya get those eyes?
Gosh all, git up, how'd they get so lit up?
Gosh all, git up, how'd they get that size?

Golly gee, when you turn those heaters on
Woe is me, got to put my cheaters on

Jeepers creepers, where'd ya get those peepers?
Oh, those weepers, how they hypnotize!
Where'd ya get those eyes?"
Jazz,"Dancing in the dark 
Till the tune ends,
We're dancing in the dark and it soon ends,
We're waltzing in the wonder of why we're here,
Time hurries by, we're here and gone;

Looking for the light of a new love,
To brighten up the night, I have you love,
And we can face the music together,
Dancing in the dark."
Jazz,"You made my soul a burning fire
You're getting to be my one desire
You're getting to be all that matters to me
And let me tell you girl
I hope and pray each day I live
A little more love I'll have to give
A little more love that's devoted and true
Cause all I do is think about you
All I do 
Oh baby
Is think about you

All I do
M-m-m-m
Is think about you
Baby just suppose I should happen to cross your mind
And by some chance a boy like me you're really been trying to find
Well let me tell you girl
Think of how exciting it would be
If you should discover you feel like me
If you should discover this dream is for two
We'll I'm gonna tell you girl
I'd light a candle every day
And pray that you'll always feel this way
And pray that our love will forever be new

If I cannot have you for my own
I'd rather be lonely and all alone
I'd rather keep thinking the way that I do

Jazz,"Now that you set everybody free What you going to do about me? Don't want to be treated like some poor grateful clown I'd rather go back in the sweet underground Where I can tell the time by the color of my skin And I know my neighbor 'cos he's the one, yes he's the one Who always turns me in A woman works the tunnel in the middle of the night Picking up every lost object in sight Handbags, toupees, lost legs and fingernails The black market eats up all your failures Her transistor offers no salvation or regrets No pool, no pets, no cigarettes Just non-stop Disco Tex and the Sex-o-lettes There's no name, there's no name There's no name, there's no name There's no name, there's no name For the pain we'll cause you again and again For the pain we'll cause you again and again The Liberation Forces make movies of their own Playing their Doors records and pretending to be stoned Drowning out a broadcast that wasn't authorized Incidentally the revolution will be televised With one head for business and another for good looks Until they started arriving with their rubber aprons and their butcher's hooks There's no name, there's no name There's no name, there's no name There's no name, there's no name For the pain we'll cause you again and again For the pain we'll cause you again and again They're hunting us down here with Liberty's light A handshaking double talking procession of the mighty Pursued by a T.V. crew and coming after them A limousine of singing stars and their brotherhood anthem The former dictator was impeccably behaved They're mopping up all the stubborn ones who just refuse to be saved I refuse to be saved [x12]"
Jazz,"Now, out of the night
New as the dawn
Into the light
This Child
Innocent Child
Soft as a fawn
This Child is born

One small heart
One pair of eyes
One work of art
Here in my arms
Here he lies
Trusting and warm
Blessed this morn
A Child is born"
Jazz,"Yours till the stars have no glory
Yours till the birds fail to sing
Yours to the end of life's story,
This pledge to you, dear, I bring.
Yours in the gray of December
Here or on far distant shores!
I've never loved anyone the way I love you 
How could I? When I was born to be just yours."
Jazz,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile"
Jazz,"Won't you come along with me
to the Mississippi
we'll take a boat to the land of dreams
Steam down the river, down to New Orleans

The band's there to meet us
Old friends there to greet us
Where all the proud and elite folks meet
Heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street

Basin Street is the street
where the best folks always meet
in New Orleans, land of dreams
you'll never know how nice it seems,
or just how much it really means

Glad to be, oh yes-siree
Where welcome's free and dear to me
Where I can lose, lose my Basin Street Blues

Basin Street, oh Basin Street
Is the street, mama (scat)
New Orleans, land of dreams
(scat)

Your little rollin' stone that rolled away
Strolled away
Mammy mine
Your rollin' stone is rollin' home today
There to stay
Just to see your smilin' face
Smile a welcome sign
When I'm in your fond embrace
Listen, Mammy mine...

Rock-a-bye your baby with a Dixie melody
When you croon, croon a tune from the heart of Dixie
Just hang my cradle, Mammy mine
Right on that Mason Dixon Line
And swing it from Virginia
To Tennessee with all the love that's in ya
""Weep No More My Lady,"" sing that song again for me
And ""Old Black Joe"" just as though you had me on your knee
A million baby kisses I'll deliver
The minute that you sing ""The Swanee River""
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye-baby with a Dixie melody

Any time
I hear a mammy sing her babe to sleep
Slumber deep
That's the time
The shadows 'round my heart begin to creep
And I weep
Wonder why I went away
What a fool I've been
Take me back to yesterday
In your arms again...

Rock-a-bye your baby with a Dixie melody
When you croon, croon a tune from the heart of Dixie
Just hang my cradle, Mammy mine

Jazz,"L.A. proved too much for the man,
So he's leavin' the life he's come to know,
He said he's goin' back to find
Ooh, what's left of his world,
The world he left behind
Not so long ago.
He's leaving, 
On that midnight train to Georgia,
And he's goin' back
To a simpler place and time.
And I'll be with him
On that midnight train to Georgia,
I'd rather live in his world
Than live without him in mine.
He kept dreamin'
That someday he'd be a star.
But he sure found out the hard way
That dreams don't always come true.
So he pawned all his hopes 
and he even sold his old car
Bought a one way ticket
To the life he once knew, 
Oh yes he did,
He said he would
Be leavin
On that midnight train to Georgia,
And he's goin' back
To a simpler place and time.
And I'll be with him
On that midnight train to Georgia,
I'd rather live in his world
Than live without him in mine.
Go, gonna board, gonna board,
Gonna board the midnight train.
Gotta go, gonna board
Gonna board
Gonna board the midnight train"
Jazz,"Hark! the herald angels sing, ""Glory to the new-born King! Peace on earth, and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled.""

It came upon a midnight clear that glorious song of old From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold Peace on the earth goodwill to men from heav'n all gracious King The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing For lo the days are hast'ning on by prophets seen of old When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold When the new heav'n and earth shall on the Prince of peace their king And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurled And still their heavenly music floats o'er all the weary world Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing Yet with the woes of sin and strife the world has suffered long Beneath the heavenly strain have rolled two thousand years of wrong And man at war with man hears not the tidings which they bring O hush the noise ye men of strife and hear the angels sing O ye, beneath life's crushing load whose forms are bending low Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing For lo the days are hastening on by prophets seen of old When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold When peace shall over all the earth its ancient splendors fling And the whole world give back the song which now the angels sing"

Jazz,"Love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind

Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind

You touch me, I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me, and with your kiss the world begins
You're Spring to me, all things to me
You're life itself

Like a leaf clings to a tree
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind, the wind
Wild is my love for you"
Jazz,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me"
Jazz,"Come on along and listen to
The lullaby of Broadway
The hip hooray and ballyhoo
The lullaby of Broadway
The rumble of a subway train
The rattle of the taxis
The daffodils who entertain
At Angelo's and Maxi's

When a Broadway baby says good night
It's early in the morning
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight
Until the dawn

Good night, baby
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day
Hey

The band begins to go to town
And everyone goes crazy
You rock a bye your baby round
'Til everything gets hazy
Hush a bye, I'll buy you this and that
You hear a daddy saying
And baby goes home to her flat
To sleep all day

Good night, baby
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day

Listen to the lullaby
Of old Broadway"
Jazz,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
How long has this, been going on?"
Jazz,"Baby baby, sweet baby
There's something that I just got to say
Baby baby, sweet baby
You left me hurtin' in a real cold way

Speak your name
Ooh and I feel a thrill
You said I do
Hey, and I said I will

I told you to just be true
And give me just a little time
Wait on me, baby, I want you to be all mine
I just get so blue

Since you've been gone, baby
(Why'd you do it? Why'd you have to do it?)
Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? Why'd you have to do it?)

Baby baby, sweet baby
I didn't mean to run you away
It was pride on my lips but not in my heart
To say the things that led you to stray

But ah, me
Hear me now
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Got to get you back somehow

I'm praying, take me back
Consider me please
If you walk in that door, I can get up off my knees
I've just been so blue

Since you've been gone, oh baby
(Why'd you do it? Why'd you have to do it?)
Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? Why'd you have to do it?)

Well I've been so lonely
(Sweet sweet, sweet sweet baby
Baby, since you've been gone
(Sweet sweet, sweet sweet baby)

I've been so lonely
(Why'd you do it? Why'd you have to do it?)
Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? Why'd you have to do it?)

Baby baby baby been so lonely

Jazz,"[including A Warm Wave Of Euphoria] [Music: O'Donnell, Lyrics: Yurkiewicz] We'r in the midst of a conspiracy that has been waged for half a cantury This sick persecution began originally by businessmen fearing the loss of money Through manipulation of corrupt industry hemp prohibition became a reality Misinformation became the legacy as the worth of this plant was maligned systematically This insane prohibition continues today implemented by the fascist at the D.E.A. Innocent people are locked away for as little as possession of a single j  By waging this ludicrous ""War"" on hemp millions of dollars are wastefully spent Imagine the progress that could be achieved if hemp were granted legally THINK ABOUT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We're all in the grasp of concocted lunacy infringing on our rights for personal liberty I think about this and I cannot believe that people are banned from enjoying THC Through perpetuation of flawed ideology hemp prohibition has been enforced tyrannicaly This fucking idiocy must be cast aside, hemp can be used to improve our lives! Let's assume unrestricted legality for medical research and potential industry There are so many possibilities for ways hemp could benefit our society! There is just no way that legality can be wrong! It's insane that the fight is taking so long I'm thirsty and we've reached the point in this song where it's time to kick back and smoke a bong..."

Jazz,"All my dreams are over, now I'm wide awake
With a lonesome feeling and a constant ache
Livin' with my memories just for old times sake
Crying my heart out for you

Hope you'll be more tender in your next affair
Trust you'll think of me dear, when you've time to spare
Praying you'll be happy is my only prayer
Crying my heart out for you

Your heart may ache you, friends may forsake you
Sometimes it happens that way
But I'm still for you, always adore you
I love you, I love you what more can I say

I was just a scholar, made for you to teach
Searching for a true love, one I couldn't reach
Now I'm just a pebble on a lonely beach
Crying my heart out for you"
Jazz,"The sleepless nights, the daily fights
The quick toboggan, when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses, and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

The broken dates, the endless waits
The lovely loving, and the hateful hates
The conversation, with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punched, drunk

The pulled out fur, of cat and cur
The fine mismating, of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words: ""I love you, 'til the day I day""
The self deception, that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma, of performing seals
The double-crossing, of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punk drunk

Believe me sir, I much prefer
The classic battle, of a him and her
I don't like quiet, and I wish I were
In love again, in love again, in love again"
Jazz,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way."
Jazz,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is."
Jazz,"(c. stepney - r. johnson)

I'm flying high about the clouds
Wherever we choose to be
A barren land becomes a paradise,
Your touch is all that I need
Whenever we are, wherever we are

Never, ever say you don't love me truly
Whenever, however, wherever
For as long as you live be faithful to me
Forever, whenever, wherever
Whenever, however, wherever

How my days are passing differently
When I'm with you the universe has no mystery
The reasons clear, for you are here
Your love colors my days
Whenever we are, wherever we are
"
Jazz,"Sweeter than sweet 
There is none to compete with Delilah 
Armful of charm and a four dream alarm, that's Delilah 
Angels tip their halos 
The moons straightens his tie 
And weeping willows smile 
As she goes by, my... 
Rarer than rare
All my life I would share 
With Delilah 
Heaven would be 
Anywhere I could see 
My Delilah 
I'll grow strong as Samson 
When she whispers, ""I do""
I'll hand her the moon and declare
""Delilah, it's for you!"" 
(repeat once)"
Jazz,"When days are long and nights are lonely
And all my daydreams have gone astray
I think about the one and only
Who's bound to find me some golden day

The one I love is coming along some day
And I'll have none except the one I love
He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

And though our meeting is left to chance
Until our meeting 
I still will have my dream romance
And through the night I pray to the moon above
To please be kind and find the one I love"
Jazz,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night"
Jazz,"Ooh

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe that God put sun and moon up in the sky.
I don't mind the gray skies
'cause they're just clouds passing by.

Heaven is a goodness time. 
A brighter light on high.

Do unto others as you would have them do to you.

And have a brighter by and by.

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe God is now, was then and always will be.
With God's blessing we can make it through eternity.

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through."
Jazz,"
A town's a lonely town,
When you pass through
And there is no one waiting there for you,
Then it's a lonely town.
You wander up and down,
The crowds rush by,
A million faces pass before your eye,
Still it's a lonely town.

Unless there's love,
A love that's shining like a harbor light,
You're lost in the night;
Unless there's love,
The world's an empty place
And every town's a lonely town.
"
Jazz,"I feel the autumn breeze,
It steals 'cross my pillow
As soft as a will-o'-the-wisp,
And in its song there is sadness
Because there's no you,

The lonely autumn trees,
How softly they're sighing,
For summer is dying,
They know that in my heart
There's no gladness
Because there's no you,

The park that we walked in,
The garden we talked in,
How lonely they seem in the fall,
The stormy clouds hover,
And falling leaves cover
Our favorite nook in the wall,

In spring we'll meet again,
We'll kiss and recapture
The summertime rapture we knew,
And from that day,
Never more will I say there's no you"
Jazz,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain."
Jazz,"Mm, my darling, my darling
Ooh, darling, oh

Now I know that you've been
Staying at home, baby, yeah, all alone
And I've been working day and night, baby
(Just working day and night)

I know that you've been
Tired of hearing the same old song
(Baby, I don't really blame ya)
For feeling all that you feel

It seems we've got a problem, I swear I'll compromize
I've been working really hard just to make it right
So I never gonna leave you again
I'll never leave you again

Ooh, it's been a long long time
Since I've seen your smile
Since I felt your touch
Ooh, I miss you so much

I've been gone for so long
And I know I were wrong
So I never gonna leave you again
I'll never gonna leave you again

And some times
I get caught up in things that I do
And boy, I never pay attention at time
(It passes so fast)

Although I call you on the phone
Honey, I get a thing
Only one thing about reality
I feel like a fool and I do

You could be spending time with somebody else
But instead you're still at home all alone night and day
So I'm never gonna leave you again
I'll never leave you again

Ooh, hoo, sha-bi-du-day
Wee-woo-bi-du-du-woop-du-du-doo
Wa-di-du-du-du-dub-di-du-du oh oh
Zip-zipn-zip-du-du-zipn-zipn-dip-yeah yeah
Wab-web-wab-web-wa-waa-waa

I'll promise that I'll never leave ya
Hoping and now I'm trying
And if you ever have a problem
Call my name and I'll be there

All I want is you
To let me back into your arms
And I'm staying by your side
Give me a chance

It seems we've got a problem, I swear I'll compromize
I've been working day and night just to make it right, baby
Never gonna leave you again
I'll never leave you again, wo auh

Well, I never gonna leave you again
I'll never leave you again
Ooh ooh, yeah, eeih yah
I'm gonna be right by your side, oh baby, yeah
I ain't going nowhere, hey yeah
Dip-di-du-du-du-du-du

"
Jazz,"Please don't be offended if I preach to you awhile, 
Tears are out of place in eyes that were meant to smile.
There's a way to make your very biggest troubles small, 
Here's the happy secret of it all.

[Chorus]
Look for the silver lining
When e'er a cloud appears in the blue.
Remember some where the sun is shining, 
And so the right thing to do, 
Is make it shine for you.
 
A heart, full of joy and gladness, 
Will always banish sadness and strife.
So always look for the silver lining, 
And try to find the sunny side of life.

As I wash my dishes, I'll be following your plan, 
Till I see the brightness in ev'ry pot and pan.
I am sure your point of view will ease the daily grind, 
So I keep repeating in my mind. 

[Chorus]"
Jazz,"Life will be a dream song
Love will be the theme song

Soon, the lonely nights will be ended
Soon, two hearts as one will be blended
When I'm with you who cares what time it is
Or what the place or the climate is

Oh! Soon, our little ship will come sailing
Home through every storm, never failing
The day you're mine this world will be in tune
Let's make that day come soon

Soon, a little cottage will find us
Safe with all our cares far behind us
The day you're mine this world will be in tune
Let's make that day come soon

Let's make that day come soon
Make it come soon"
Jazz,"Forget your troubles (Happy days)
Come on get happy (are here again)
You better chase all your cares away 
(The skies above are clear again)
Shout hallelujah (So let's sing a song)
Come on get happy (of cheer again)
Get ready for the judgment day (Happy days are here again)

The sun is shining
Come on get happy (Shout it now)
The Lord is waiting to take your hand 
(There's no one who can doubt it now)
Shout hallelujah (So let's tell the world)
And just get happy (about it now)
We're going to the promise land 
(Happy days are here again)

We're heading across the river
Soon your cares will all be gone
There'll be no more from now on
From now on

Forget your troubles (Happy days)
And just get happy (are here again)
You better chase all your blues away 
(The skies above are clear again)
Shout hallelujah (So let's sing a song)
And just get happy (of cheer again)

Happy times (Happy times)
Happy nights (Happy nights)
Happy days
Are here again"
Jazz,"Every honey bee fills with jealousy,
When they see you out with me.

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

When you're passin' by flowers droop and sigh,
And I know the reason why.

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Don't buy sugar,
You just have to touch my cup.
You're my sugar.
It's sweeter when you stir it up.

When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
Seems the honey fairly drips.

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Don't buy sugar,
You just have to touch my cup.
You're my sugar.
It's sweeter when you stir it up.

When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
Seems the honey fairly drips.

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose"
Jazz,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
On Green Dolphin Street
"
Jazz,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I"
Jazz,"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight.
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kid is knocking him down.

When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Canadian way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Walking in a winter wonderland,
Walking in a winter wonderland."
Jazz,"we 've got to love to love each other
we 've got to live like sister and brother

have you seen people coming out like you a saint
actin' like an angel but you really aint
why not try the new way  
what they can give

over this one full lane

we love each other
always using someone like they were a two
change you r way of thinking"
Jazz,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you"
Jazz,"Me, myself and I
Are all in love with you
We all think you're wonderful
We do

Me, myself and I
Have just one point of view
We're convinced
There's no one else like you
It can't be denied dear
You brought the sun to us
We'd be satisfied dear
If you, you'd belong to one of us

So if you pass me by
Three hearts will break in two
Cause me, myself and I

Jazz,"Hey please don't look back
Things are getting better
Yes they are my friend
I know it's hard
Just have faith my friend
Now the clouds are gone
Heaven's open wide for you
Yes they did my friend
It's not so hard
Just have faith and pray to God
And happiness ad love will shine through
All the gloom and darkness in the room
Hey hey
Please don't look abcl
Things are getting better
Yes teya re cuz things are getting better just 

Say hey

Things are getting better
Just believe it
Just believe my friend"
Jazz,"I see trees of green, red roses too
I see 'em bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world 

I see skies of blue, clouds of white
The bright blessed days, and dark sacred nights
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world 
 
The colors of the rainbow
Are so pretty in the sky
It's also on the faces
Of people goin' by
I see friends shakin' hands
Sayin', ""How do you do?""
They're really sayin' I, ""I love you.""

I hear babies cry, and I watch 'em grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
I think to myself, what a wonderful world"
Jazz,"Just we meet the sunshine with your smile
I will be okay
No matter if the rain falls like you call
I will be okay
Just meet me the sunshine with your smile
I will be okay
No matter if the rain falls like you call
I will be okay

It's gonna be alright, I know it's gonna be okay
It's gonna be alright, with you I know I'm gonna be okay
It's gonna be alright, I know it's gonna be okay

Give me ? I don't care as long ans I'm with you
I know I'm gonna be with you, it's gonna be alright

Be alright, be okay,
Be alright, ohh

Okay"
Jazz,"They say that falling love is wonderful
It's wonderful, so they say
And with the moon up above, it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I've never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance
Is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

To leave your house some morning
And without any warning, you're stopping people,
Shouting that love is grand, and
To hold a man in your arms is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say"
Jazz,"Here we go again
She's back in town again
I'll take her back again
One more time

Here we go again
The phone will ring again
I'll be her fool again
One more time

I've been there before
And I'll try it again
But any fool knows
That there's no way to win

Here we go again
She'll break my heart again
I'll play the part again
One more time

Here we go again
She'll break my heart again
I'll play the part again
One more time

I'll take her back again
One more time"
Jazz,"Lover, when I'm near you
And I hear you
Speak my name
Softly, in my ear
You breathe a flame

Lover, when we're dancing
Keep on glancing in my eyes
Til loves own enchanting music dies

All of my future is in you
You're every plan I desire
Promise you'll always continue
To be mine

Lover, please be tender
When your tender fears depart
Lover, I surrender
To my heart

All of my future is in you
You're every plan I desire
Promise you'll always continue
To be mine

Lover, please be tender
When your tender fears depart
Lover, I surrender
To my heart"
Jazz,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
And dear, I wonder if you find love
An optical illusion, too?

Are the stars out tonight?
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
Cause I only have eyes for you, dear
The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
Cause I only have eyes for you.

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you"
Jazz,"I try to keep  you out of my heart
But somehow I find
Trying to keep you out of my heart
I'm out of my mind
I tell myself ""I'm through with you
And I'll having nothing more to do with you""
I stay away, but every day
I'm just foolin myself

Tell my friends that I don't care
I shrug my shoulders at the whole affair
But all know it isn't so
I'm just foolin myself

And every time I pass
And see my face in a looking glass
I tip my hat and say
""How do you do, you fool
You're trowing your life away""
I'm acting gay
I'm acting proud
And every time I see you in a crowd
I may pretend
But in the end
I'm just fooling myself"
Jazz,"I went down to the water, all night long
I'm putting my feet in, all night long

And I went down to the water, all night long
And I'm putting my dreams in, all night long

And what you think of me, I can't say
I'll take these bad dreams and I'll drove along the way

I'm at the shore now, the shadows at my back
I can feel the waves coming there, heavy and black

But I can't turn away now 'cause I
They're singin' a song

And I, I'm in harmony
I'm singing along

And what you did to me I, I can't take no more
I'll take these bad dreams and I'll lay them at the shore

The end of the ocean I'll never see
I stare out in the distance and it's looking back at me

And I'll look down to the water all night long
And I'll put my feet in, all night long

And I'll put my dreams in, all night long
And I'll put my tears in, all night long
I went down to the water"
Jazz,"Way down yonder in New Orleans
In the land of the dreamy scenes
There's a Garden of Eden
You know what I mean

Creole babies with flashin' eyes
Softly whisper their tender sighs then stop
Won't you give your lady fair a little smile?
Stop, ya bet your life you'll linger there a little while

We've got heaven right here on earth
With those beautiful queens
Way down yonder in New Orleans

You're gonna find heaven right here on earth
With all them beautiful queens
Way down yonder in New Orleans
I'm goin' down yonder to New Orleans
It's way down yonder in New Orleans"
Jazz,"My gal and I, we had a fight 
And I'm all by myself
I guess she thinks now that she's gone
I'll lay right on the shelf
I'm gonna show her she's all wrong
No lonesome stuff for mine
I won't sit home, all alone
She'll soon find that I'm
 
Runnin' wild,  lost control
Runnin' wild, mighty bold
Feelin' gay, reckless too
Care free mind all the time, never blue
Always goin' don't know where
Always showin', I don't care
Don't love nobody, it's not worth while
All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
 
When I first met that gal of mine
It seemed just like a dream
But when she tho't she had me right
She started actin' mean
Like mary led her little lamb 
She led me all the time
Until the worm had to turn
That's the reason I'm
 
Runnin' wild,  lost control
Runnin' wild, mighty bold
Feelin' gay, reckless too
Care free mind all the time, never blue
Always goin' don't know where
Always showin', I don't care
Don't love nobody, it's not worth while
All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
 
No gal will ever make a fool of me
No gal! I mean just what I say
I ain't the simpleton I used to be
Wonder how I got that way
 
Once I was full of sentiment, it's true
But now I got a cruel heart
With all that other foolishness I'm through
Gonna play the Villain part
 
Runnin' wild,  lost control
Runnin' wild, mighty bold
Feelin' gay, reckless too
Care free mind all the time, never blue
Always goin' don't know where
Always showin', I don't care
Don't love nobody, it's not worth while
All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
"
Jazz,"Come to me my melancholy baby, 
Cuddle up and don't be blue 
All your fears are foolish fancy, maybe 
You know dear that I'm in love with you! 

Every cloud must have a silver lining 
Wait until the sun shines through 
Smile my honey dear, while I kiss away each tear 
Or else I shall be melancholy too! 

Every cloud must have a silver lining 
Wait until the sun shines through 
Smile my honey dear, while I kiss away each tear 
Or else I shall be melancholy too!"
Jazz,"I don't want you, but I'd hate to lose you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
I forgive you, 'cause I can't forget you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

[Repeat: x2]
I ought to cross you off my list
But when you come a-knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more
I should hate you, but I guess I love you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
The devil and the deep blue sea"
Jazz,"Woo, 
Wo-o-oo-wo-wo, 
Wo-o-oo-wo-wo, 
Wo-o-oo-wo-wo
When the deep purple falls
Over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to twinkle in the night
In the mist of a memory
You wander all back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh

In the still of the night
Once again I hold you tight
Tho' you're gone your love lives on when light beams
And as long as my heart will beat
Sweet lover, we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams

When the deep purple falls
Over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to twinkle
In the night
In the mist of a memory
You wander all back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh

In the still of the night 
Once again I hold you tight
Tho' you're gone your love lives on when moonlight beams
And as long as my heart will beat
Sweet lover, we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams
And as long as my heart will beat
Sweet lover, we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams
Wo-o-oo-wo-wo, 
Wo-o-oo-wo-wo, 
Wo-o-oo-wo-wo"
Jazz,"I'm blue every Monday
Thinking only of Sunday
That's one day when I'm with you
It seems I sigh all day Tuesday
I cry all day Wednesday
Oh my how I long for you
And then comes Thursday, gee it's long it never goes by
Friday makes me feel like I'm gonna die
But after payday it's my fun day
I shine all day Sunday
That's one day when I'm with you
Want to see you next Sunday!"
Jazz,"Lay down my dear Brother, lay down and take your rest I want to lay your head upon your Savior's breast I love you, but Jesus loves you best I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight Lay down my dear Brother, lay down and take your rest I want to lay your head upon your Savior's breast I love you, but Jesus loves you best I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight One of these mornings bright and early and soon, goodnight Now they're pickin' up the spirit to the shore beyond, goodnight Go walking in the valley of the shadow of death, goodnight His rod and his staff, gonna comfort me, goodnight Join the wise, there's a soul to find, goodnight Lord send a fire, not a flood next time, goodnight To leave for the ark, that wonderful boat, goodnight She really loaded down, getting water to float, goodnight Now pray for the beast at the ending of the world, goodnight He'll eat all the children that would not be good, goodnight I remember right well, I remember right well, goodnight I went walking to Jerusalem just like John Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight Lay down my dear brother, lay down and take your rest I want to lay your head upon your Saviors breast I love you, but Jesus loves you best I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight"
Jazz,"Deep rhythm captivates me
Hot rhythms stimulate me
Can't help but swing it boy
Swing it brothers swing
Don't stop to diddle daddle
Stop this foolish prattle
Come on swing me boy
Swing it brothers swing
Raring to go and there ain't nobody
Gonna hold me down
Say listen boy

Hurry up and send me
Let me go to town
Stop this diddle daddle
And this foolish prattle
Come on kill me boy
Swing it brothers swing

Deep rhythms captivate me
Hot rhythms stimulate me
Can't help but swing it boy
Swing it brothers swing
Don't stop to diddle daddle
Stop this foolish prattle
Come on send me Count
Swing it brothers swing
Rarin' to go and there ain't nobody
Gonna hold me down
Say listen boy
Hurry up and send me
Let me go to town
Stop this diddle daddle
And this foolish prattle
Come on swing me Count
Swing it brothers swing"
Jazz,"I keep waiting for a song to come and sing you back to me
I never felt so free as when I had you
Your rhythm was the best that's touched the likes of me
I was really me when I had you

Give me back that old familiar feeling
That left me feeling like I was someone
Give me back the song we sang in harmony
Just you and me singing together

My radio, it still plays the songs you like to hear
As if you were here, oh, I love you
I'll take the time to tune the station in real clear
Like when you were here, oh, I need you

Give me back that old familiar feeling
That left me feeling like I was someone
Give me back the song we sang in harmony
Just you and me singing together

Give me back that old familiar feeling
That left me feeling like I was someone
Give me back the song we sang in harmony
Just you and me singing together

Give me back that old familiar feeling
That left me feeling like I was someone
Give me back the song we sang in harmony
Just you and me singing together, singing together

"
Jazz,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you."
Jazz,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile"
Jazz,"People get ready
There's a train a comin'
You don't need no baggage you just get on board
All you need is faith
To hear the diesel comin'
Don't need no ticket you just thank the Lord

People get ready
Train to Jordan
Picking up passengers from coast to coast
Faith is key
Open the doors and board them
There's hope for all among the love the most

There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own soul
Have pity on those whose choices grow thinner
There ain't no hiding place from the Kingdom's throne

People get ready
There's a train a comin'
You don't need no baggage you just get on board
All you need is faith
To hear the diesel comin'
Don't need no ticket you just thank the Lord

There's a train there's a train there's a train comin' people
There's a train there's a train there's a train comin' people
There's a train there's a train there's a train comin' people
Just get on board

There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own soul
Have pity on those whose choices grow thinner
There ain't no hiding place from the Kingdom's throne"
Jazz,"I can't believe that you're not here with me
To have a laugh or share a tear with me
It's all so wrong it can't be right
It must have been something I dreamed last night

To never see your funny face again
To never thrill to your embrace again
Oh, it's so wrong it can't be right
It must have been something I dreamed last night

Those midnight suppers for two
Our silly duets at dawn
Those crazy moments with you
Don't tell me that they are gone

To never look into those eyes again
The sun might just as well not rise again
Oh, no, no, no, it can't be right
It must have been something I dreamed last night

I've set the table and a plate for you
Making believe you will soon be here
I watched the dawn sit and wait for you
It's impossible, hard as I try to convince myself
We've said goodbye

To never look into those eyes again
The sun might just as well not rise again
Oh, no, no, no, it can't be right
It must have been something I dreamed last night"
Jazz,"Now we're dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Oh man, it's fun, it really is fun to ride in a open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Alright"
Jazz,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die"
Jazz,"Know it sounds funny
But, I just can't stand the pain
Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me girl
You know I've done all I can
You see I begged, stole, and I borrowed! (yeah)

Ooh that's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning!

Why in the world would anybody put chains on me?
I've paid my dues to make it
Everybody wants me to be
What they want me to be
I'm not happy when I try to fake it! no!

Ooh that's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning!

I wanna be high, so high
I wanna be free to know
The things I do are right
I wanna be free
Just me! Whoa, oh! Babe!

That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning, yeah
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning, whoa
'Cause I'm easy
Easy like Sunday morning, yeah
'Cause I'm easy
Easy like Sunday morning"
Jazz,"East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day
Love will not die, 
We'll keep it that way
Up among the stars 
We'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon dear
East of the sun and west of the moon"
Jazz,"Easy
Take love easy, easy easy
Never let your feelings show
Make it breezy, breezy breezy
Easy come and easy go

Never smile too brightly brightly
When your heart is riding high
Let your heart break oh-so slightly
When your baby says goodbye

That well known flame is mighty hot
As all of us have learned
So handle it with velvet gloves
And you won`t get your fingers burned

Take love easy, easy
On the free and easy plan
And if you can't take it easy
Take it easy as you can

Take love easy, easy
Never let your feelings show
Make it breezy, breezy, easy
Easy, easy come and easy go

Never smile too brightly brightly
When your heart is riding high
Let your heart break, oh so slightly
When your baby says goodbye

That well known flame is mighty hot
As all of us have learned
So handle it, handle it with velvet gloves
And you won`t get your fingers burned

Take love easy, easy easy
On the free and easy plan
And if you can`t take it easy
Take it easy as you can

Take it easy
Take it easy
Take it easy, take it easy, take it easy, take it easy"
Jazz,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you"
Jazz,"It's June in January Because I'm in love It always is spring in my heart With you in my arms The snow is just white blossoms That fall from above And here is the reason, my dear Your magical charms The night is cold The trees are bare But I can feel the scent of roses in the air It's June in January Because I'm in love But only because I'm in love with you (The night is cold) (The trees are bare) But I can feel the scent of roses in the air It's June in January Because I'm in love But only because I'm in love with you"
Jazz,"I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves, then I recall
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms
Of course, I do
But I get along without you very well

I've forgotten you just like I should
Of course I have
Except to hear your name
Or someone's laugh that is the same
But I've forgotten you just like I should

What a guy, what a fool am I
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon
What's in store? Should I phone once more?
No, it's best that I stick to my tune

I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except perhaps in spring
But I should never think of spring
For that would surely break my heart in two"
Jazz,"God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our savior
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray

Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

From God our heavenly father
The blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How bad in Bethlehem was born
The son of God by name

Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises
All you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace
This holy tide of Christmas
All ever that you can face

Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy"
Jazz,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love"
Jazz,"Everything I have is yours
You're part of me
Everything I have is yours
My destiny

I would gladly give the sun to you
If the sun were only mine
I would gladly give the earth to you
And the stars that shine

Everything that I posses
I offer you

Make my dream of happiness come true
I'd be happy just to spent my life
Waiting at your beck and call

Everything I have is yours
My life, my all

I'd be happy just to spent my life
Waiting at your beck and call

Everything I have is yours
My life, my all

"
Jazz,"My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of May, no twinkling stars
No hide away, no soft guitars

My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
My romance doesn't need a thing but you

My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of May, no twinkling stars
No hide away, no soft guitars

My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
My romance doesn't need a thing but you"
Jazz,"I hadn't anyone till you,
I was a lonely one 'til you,
I used to lie awake and wonder if there could be
A someone in the wide world just made for me,
Now I see

I had to save my love for you, (I saved my love for you)
I never gave my love 'til you, (I saved it all for you)
And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.

I kept my love in secrecy,
I put it under lock and key,
I had to save my love for you!
I never gave my love away,
I waited for that lucky day
When I could give it to you

And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you."
Jazz,"A corner of the world
A moment out of time
Two people chance to meet
How bitter sweet
How sublime
And clinging there a while 
To gaze across the years
And hope the sun that sets
Brings no regrets
And no tears
And the farewell bow
The lingered kiss goodbye
And who explains the how
And why
These are memories for our time
Two think an escapade
A fly by night affair
Became an interlude
That I've perused
Everywhere"
Jazz,"""I'm the Sheik of Araby, 
Your love belongs to me.
At night when you're asleep 
Into your tent I'll creep.
The stars that shine above,
Will light our way to love.
You'll rule this land with me;"
Jazz,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Someday there'll be no more Old Folks
What a lonesome old town this will be
Children's voice at play, will be still for a day
The day they take the Old Folks away"
Jazz,"In the still of the night
As I gaze from of my window
At the moon in its flight
My thoughts all stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh, the times without number
Darling, when I say to you

Do you love me
As I love you?
Are you my life to be
My dream come true?
Or will this dream of mine
Fade out of sight?

Like the moon growing dim
On the rim of the hill
In the chill, still of the night

In the still of the night"
Jazz,"You're walking along the street, or you're at a party
Or else you're alone and then you suddenly dig
You're looking in someone's eyes
You suddenly realize
That this could be the start of something big

You're lunching at ""21"", you're watching your diet
Declining a charlotte russe, accepting a fig
When out of a clear blue sky
It's suddenly gal and guy
And this could be the start of something big

There's no controlling the unrolling of your fate, my friend
Who knows what's written in the magic book
But when a lover you discover at the gate, my friend
Invite her in without a second look

You're up in an aeroplane or dining at Sardi's
Or lying at Malibu, alone on the sand
You suddenly hear a bell
And right away you can tell
That this could be the start of something grand

This could be the start of something very big
Why don't you play your part
Please give your heart to me, and see
This could be the start of something wonderful
Why don't you take a chance
And try romance with me, and see

You're watching the sun come up or counting your money
Or else in a dim cafe, you're ordering wine
Then suddenly there he is
And you want to be where he is
And this must be the start of something
This could be the heart of something
This could be the start of something... big!"
Jazz,"I'd wait for you
I'd slave for you
I'd be a beggar or a knave for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along

I'd gladly move
The earth for you
To prove my love, dear
And its worth for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along.

With all the words, dear, at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you darling
Come what may
My heart is yours
What more can I say?

I'd lie for you
I'd sigh for you
I'd tear the stars down from the sky for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along

With all the words, dear, at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you baby
Come what may
My heart is yours
What more can I say?

I'd lie for you
I'd cry for you
I'd lay my body down and die tor you
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along"
Jazz,"I may be wrong but I think you're wonderful
I may be wrong but I think you're swell
I like your style say, I think it's marvelous
I'm always wrong so how can I tell
Deuces to me are all aces
Life is to me just a bore
Faces are all open spaces
You might be John Barrymore
You came along say I think you're wonderful
I think you're grand but I may be wrong

I may be wrong but I think you're wonderful
I may be wrong but I think you're swell
I like your style say, I really think it's marvelous
I'm always wrong so how can I tell
Deuces to me are all aces
Life is to me just a bore
Faces are all open spaces
You might be John Barrymore
You came along say I think you're wonderful
I think you're grand but I may be wrong

You said that Edison would never make that light
You laughed at Mr. Franklin with his key and kite
The point of the song is I'm always wrong
But with you baby I'm oh so right."
Jazz,"In dreams I kiss your hand, madame
Your dainty fingertips
And while in slumber land, madame
I'm begging for your lips
I haven't any right, madame
To do the things I do
Just when I hold you tight, madame
You vanish with the night, madame
In dreams I kiss your hand, madame
And pray my dreams come true

In dreams I kiss your hand, madame
Your dainty fingertips
And while in slumber land, madame
I'm begging for your lips
I haven't any right, madame
To do the things I do
Just when I hold you tight, madame
You vanish with the night, madame
In dreams I kiss your hand, madame
And pray my dreams come true"
Jazz,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around
Feelin' sad
Really gets bad
Round, Round, Round Midnight"
Jazz,"Easy
Take love easy, easy easy
Never let your feelings show
Make it breezy, breezy breezy
Easy come and easy go

Never smile too brightly brightly
When your heart is riding high
Let your heart break oh-so slightly
When your baby says goodbye

That well known flame is mighty hot
As all of us have learned
So handle it with velvet gloves
And you won`t get your fingers burned

Take love easy, easy
On the free and easy plan
And if you can't take it easy
Take it easy as you can

Take love easy, easy
Never let your feelings show
Make it breezy, breezy, easy
Easy, easy come and easy go

Never smile too brightly brightly
When your heart is riding high
Let your heart break, oh so slightly
When your baby says goodbye

That well known flame is mighty hot
As all of us have learned
So handle it, handle it with velvet gloves
And you won`t get your fingers burned

Take love easy, easy easy
On the free and easy plan
And if you can`t take it easy
Take it easy as you can

Take it easy
Take it easy
Take it easy, take it easy, take it easy, take it easy"
Jazz,"Me, myself and I
Are all in love with you
We all think you're wonderful
We do

Me, myself and I
Have just one point of view
We're convinced
There's no one else like you

It can't be denied, dear
You brought the sun to us
We'd be satisfied, dear
If you'd belong to one of us

So if you pass me by
Three hearts will break in two
'Cause me, myself and I
Are all in love with you

Yes, it can't be denied, dear
You brought the sun to us
We'd be satisfied, dear
If you'd belong to one of us

If you pass me by
Three hearts will break in two
'Cause me, myself and I
Are all in love with you

"
Jazz,"I can only give you love that lasts forever,
And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more, that's all, that's all."
Jazz,"You can dance
Every dance with the guy who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile

Every smile for the man who held your hand
'neath the pale moonlight
But don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me
Well you can know
That the music's fine like sparklin' wine
Go and have your fun
Love and sing

But while we're apart, don't you give your heart to anyone
But don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
Baby don't you know I love you so
Can't you feel it when we touch
I will never never let you go

I love you so much
Well you can dance
You can carry on till the night is gone
And it's time to go
If he asks
If you're all alone, can he take you home
You must tell him no

Cause don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me"
Jazz,"When I try to sing, you say I'm off key
Why can't you see how much this hurts me
With your perfect beauty and your perfect pitch
You're a perfect terror
When I come around must you always put me down

If you say my singing is off key, my love
You will hurt my feelings don't you see, my love
I wish I had an ear like yours
A voice that would behave
All I have is feeling and a voice gone deaf

You insist my music goes against the rules
Yes, but rules were never meant for lovesick fools
I wrote this little song for you, but you don't care
It's a crooked song, oh but all my heart is there

The things that you would see if you would do your part
Is even if I'm out of tune I have a gentle heart
I took your picture with my trusty Rollaflex
And now all I have developed is a complex

Possibly in vain I hope you weaken, oh my love
And forget these rigid rules that undermine my dream of
A life of love and music with someone who'll understand
That even though I may be out of tune
When I attempt to say how much I love you
All that matters is the message that I bring 
Which is my key one: I love you"
Jazz,"It ain't necessarily so
It ain't necessarily so
The things that yo' liable to read in the Bible
It ain't necessarily so

Li'l David was small but oh my
Li'l David was small but oh my
He fought big Goliath who lay down and die-eth
Li'l David was small but oh my

Oh Jonah he lived in a whale
Oh Jonah he lived in a whale
For he made his home in dat fish's abdomen
Oh Jonah he lived in a whale

Li'l Moses was found in a stream
Li'l Moses was found in a stream

He floated on water 'til ole Pharaoh's daughter
She fished him she says from that stream

It ain't necessarily so
Ain?t necessarily so!
Dey tell all you chillun that debble's a villain
But ain?t necessarily so

Methus'lah lived nine hundred years
Methus'lah lived nine hundred years
But who calls dat livin' when no gal'll give in
To no man whose nine hundred years

It ain't necessarily so
It ain't necessarily so"
Jazz,"If you are but a dream
I hope I never waken
It's more than I could bear
To find that I'm forsaken

If you're a fantasy
Then I'm content to be
In love with lovely you
And pray my dream comes true

I long to kiss you
But I would not dare
I'm so afraid
That you may vanish in the air

So, darling
If our romance should break up
I hope I never wake up
If you are but a dream

I long to kiss you
But I would not dare
I'm so afraid
That you may vanish in the air

So, darling
If our romance should break up
I hope I never wake up
If you are but a dream"
Jazz,"If you want me to stay, I'll be around today
To be available for you to see
I'm about to go there then you'll know
For me to stay here, I've got to be me

You'll never be in doubt that's what it's all about
You can't take me for granted and smile
Count the days I'm gone, forget reachin' me by phone
'Cause I promise I'll be gone for a while

And when you see me again, I hope that you have been
The kind of person a that you really are now
You got to get it straight, how could I ever be late
When you're my woman, taking up my time

Oh how could I ever allow, I guess I wonder how
I could get out a pocket for fun
When you know that you're never number two
Number one's gonna be number one

I'll be good, I wish I could
(I'll be good, I wish I could)
Get this message over to you now
(This message over to you now)

And when you see me again, I hope that you have been
The kind of person a that you really are now
I'll be so good, I wish I could
Get this message over to you now

Get this message over to you now
I'll be so good, I wish I could
"
Jazz,"One thing will lead to another
One touch and I'm closer to you
Oh, how I yearn to discover
All of the things I need to do
To live, to live to live all life of luxury
Holding you in my arms
Your heart, your heart, your heart
Your heart would belong to me
If I only knew where to start

One way to win your affection
One way to make that connection
I believe there's one way to your love
Love for life is my affliction
You are my sublime addiction
I believe there's one way to your love

Should I stand on a mountain
Should I dream of you here
Oh, it pours from me like a fountain
Still I can't have you near
To love, to love, to love, to love, to love you
Like a jewel in my arms
Your heart, your heart, your heart
Your heart would belong to me
If I only knew where to start

One way to win your affection
One way to make that connection
I believe there's one way to your love
Love for life is my affliction
You are my sublime addiction
I believe there's a way to your love

There's one way, one way to your love
There's one way, one way to your love
One way, one way, one way, one way to your love
One way, one way, one way, one way, one way to your love
One way, one way, one way to your love
There's one way, there's one way to your love"
Jazz,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain."
Jazz,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

"
Jazz,"(To Clara)
What, that chile ain`t asleep yet? Give him to me.
I`ll fix him for you.
(Jake takes the baby from Clara)

Lissen to yo` daddy warn you,
`Fore you start a-travelling,
Woman may born you, love you and mourn you,
But a woman is a sometime thing,
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.

Oh, a woman is a sometime thing.

Yo` mammy is the first to name you,
Then she`ll tie you to her apron string,
Then she`ll shame you and she`ll blame you
Till yo` woman comes to claim you,
`Cause a woman is a sometime thing,
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.

Oh, a woman is a sometime thing.

Don`t you never let a woman grieve you
Just 'cause she got yo` weddin` ring.
She`ll love you and deceive you,
Take yo` clothes and leave you
`Cause a woman is a sometime thing.

Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing,
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.

There now, what I tells you; he`s asleep already."
Jazz,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you."
Jazz,"Como e' bella ce' la luna brille e' strette strette como e' tutta bella a passeggiare Sotto il cielo di Roma Down each avenue or via, street or strata You can see 'em disappearing two by two On an evening in Roma Do they take 'em for espresso Yeah, I guess so On each lover's arm a girl I wish I knew On an evning in Roma Though there's grining and mandolining in sunny Italy The beginning has just begun when the sun goes down So please meet me in the plaza near your casa I am only one and one is one too few On an evening in Roma Don't know what the country's coming to But in Rome do as the Romans do Will you on an evening in Roma"
Jazz,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me"
Jazz,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known,
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you"
Jazz,"Bye bye, love, bye bye, happiness
Hello loneliness, I think I m gonna cry
Bye bye, love, bye bye, sweet caress
Hello emptiness, I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love, good-bye

There goes my baby with someone new
She sure looks happy, I sure am blue
She was my baby till he stepped in
Good-bye to romance that might have been

Bye bye, love, bye bye, happiness
Hello loneliness, I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye, love, bye bye, sweet caress
Hello emptiness, I feel like I could die
Bye bye, my love, good-bye

I'm through with romance, I'm through with love
I'm through with countin' the stars above
And here's the reason that I'm so free
My loving baby is through with me

Bye bye, love, bye bye, happiness
Hello loneliness, I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye, love, bye bye, sweet caress
Hello emptiness, I feel like I could die
Bye bye, my love, good-bye
Bye bye, my love, good-bye
Bye bye, my love, good-bye"
Jazz,"World seems to come and go
When you're driving in your car
The world seems to come and go
It don't matter where you are

World seems to come and go
I passed the same car an hour ago
Looks just like the car
Of a boy that I used to know, yeah

I wonder is he listening
Can he hear these words that I'm thinking?
And sometimes when it's late at night
Does he remember?

World seems to come and go
When you're driving in your car
The world seems to come and go
It don't matter who you are

Looks like today is another day
But I can't say that I can say
Cause there ain't a single thing that I know
Except how the world it comes and it goes

A hundred miles ago, up above
I saw a thunderhead shaped like a dove
But now the storm has torn it apart
Like a boy who found an open window
Flew out of my broken heart

World seems to come and go
When I'm driving in my car
World seems to come and go
It don't matter where you are

And now I passed another town
I close my eyes before I look around
And I listen for that old familiar sound, yeah

World seems to come and go
When I'm driving in my car
The world seems to come and go
It don't matter where you are

The world seems to come and go
When you're driving in your car
The world seems to come and go
It don't matter who you are

So, so, so
It don't matter who you are
So, so, so"
Metal,"I've been standing on the edge of the roof looking down
I've been looking at the people that are gathering around
I've been here for an hour or maybe even more
Just looking at the people that I've never seen before
Stupid little faces are all I can see
Those silly little suckers are all laughing at me
No wills cheap thrills you're puppets to the master
Your only satisfaction is my lonely disaster
You learned how to creep and you learned how to crawl
But you never really learned anything at all
When I was a boy everything was just fine
I learned how to talk and how to walk in line
I had to learn the rules that build our society
But I could never understand it didn't mean shit to me
Everybody always told me I was out of my mind
But I never did kiss anybody's behind
I'm a lot older and I guess I should know
But I'm standing on the roof just watching the show
Standing on the edge and my step belongs to me
But I'm telling you all I won't miss what I see
One foot over there's no time to turn around
Both feet are over and I'm heading for the ground
I'm flying in the air and I can feel the cool breeze
The people on the pavement have gone into a freeze
No space no time it's like walking on the moon
My heart is still beating but it won't be soon
I can hear myself scream when I hit the street
I can't feel a thing from my head to my feet
I told you I would do it and I didn't even cry
I feel more alive dead than when I was alive"
Metal,"With a gun to your head,
You still wouldn't change the way you are.
And I can see your callous dreams
Are the reason for your greed.
They are all the same - always
Dying to attain success and wealthiness behind closed doors.

We all
Are fighting so hard to make you see
That we all
Want more than your superficial dreams.
We are
Most mysterious creatures
To kill for what we believe.
We all want more.

So wrap your arms around me tight.
I know it's hard for you to hear,
But failure is just a part of life.
It's harder than it seems.
Because if we were meant to fly,
Why are wings so hard to come by?
So close the door (close the door).

We all
Are fighting so hard to make you see
That we all
Want more than your superficial dreams.

We are
Most mysterious creatures
To kill for what we believe.
We all want more.

Left behind,
Life is so unkind.
Why even try?"
Metal,"see the light and feel my warm desire
run through your veins like the evening sun
my father was a handsome man
but i am his exception
and at each station of hatred
i still claim to be his son
see the light and feel my warm desire
run through your veins like the evening sun
it will live but no eyes will see it
i was broken in the water
i may be this way forever
eyes will see it
with the music of my flesh
and creeping hair around my neck
eyes will see it
at the rim of cotton
on my bedroom dress
the gunfire of his hate
launches my excess
but my wish won't kill him
though even god forgot me
my words weak and ill
misery wrote my plea
this will be his will
no eyes will see it"

Your way
Your stuck in my way
Always

Tied in the innocence when we would I don't need it I don't want it alone

There's poison coming from the TV
The buzzing attracts the fleas
I've seen the sun rise for weeks

We're lost in each other
What's one without the other?
Fused together, fused together

Paranoid by the sound of the streets
Wood creaks like the march of machines
My blood lust consuming me
My hunger is matched by my greed

We're lost in each other
What's one without the other?
Fused together, fused together

We're lost in each other

Death trap
You can't disappear
I'm your death trap

Rising up from the ashes

Misdirections of rotting corpses

Five more minutes and we'll all be dead

Skeleton closets, close up tight
A perfect illness gone clear of life
In the frightened presence

Nailed to a heart felt decision
If God turned today I'd meet you in hell
Will I meet you in hell? Yes I'll meet you in hell
Will I meet you in hell?

Look in the eyes of the six fingered beast
Percussion is a cancer spreading to your cage
Blue light, beauty's got it's victim by the tail

(Five more minutes and we'll all be dead)
I'm sleeping, in a sleep upon a bed of nails
Won't you wake me up with your kiss
And give me
One moment of bliss

Flesh to bone is a purity process
Touch.. touch.. before the fall
Before the fall, before the fall

 Five more minutes and we'll all be dead
 Five more minutes and we'll all be dead

Open your mouth and accept it..."
Metal,"As the flame of the candle stands still into the biting air,
And the silhouettes of a broken man crash to the floor.
He rues the day he flew too close to the sun.
Recalling her smile as his wings melted
And he descended to the depths blow.
She had spoken of things all too impossible for hearts to behold.
Her beauty beckoning his soul.
Defenseless he fell enamored by her intoxicating charm,

She had spoken of things which he bagan to believe.
This was not supposed to be.
Screamed the temptress.
Her lack of empathy being her only vice she constructed a heart shaped tomb.
There she swore she would lay and perish.
With his wings charred and the pieces of his heart lying in ruins on the floor.
She had spoken of things all too impossible for hearts to behold.
He dreams of a day when the candle would begin to flicker in the cold night air,
Perhaps then he would fly again. he will fly again"
Metal,"I was born one morning in December
On the coldest day
Abandoned by my mother
By my father I was raised
My father raised my brother and I
With a stubborn heart
My mother left me her good looks and confident charm
Well I spent most of my teenage years
Searching for her love
I could not find it anywhere
So I turned to drugs
And after all the smoke had cleared
And it was said and done
I found myself addicted by the age of 21
I tell the truth
I've been beaten
I've been bruised
I was left for dead as well
I was wrongfully accused
You left me locked inside a cell
I've been cheated
I've been sued
But I have lived to tell
The more you kick me when I'm down
The more it truly helps
I feel the madness creeping slowly
Loved by many I'm still lonely
Paid the price for your mistake
The music died the day I walked away
No, I won't let you win!
Not this time my friend
You know that I'm better in the end
No, you won't take my pride!
I'll keep my head held high
Cause I know that I'm better in the end
Woaaah
I know you're jealous
And you wish you could be me
I'm so smart and clever with my lyrics can't you see?
There's nobody better in this Music Industry!
And in case you think you are, go ahead, give me a ring!
Woaaah
I deserve a purple heart
From all my fucking wounds!
Lacerations to my ego
Pride that I consume
And in your final hours
When you are looking back
You'll find that I'm the best at what I do
And that's a fact
No, I won't let you win!
Not this time my friend
You know that I'm better in the end.
No, you won't take my pride!
I'll keep my head held high
Cause I know that I'm better in the end
And all got to say
(Do do do do do do do do, bah bah bah da
Do do do do do do do do, la la la la la la)
Take it or leave it
But you best believe me it's true!
There's no mistaking, please stop thinking I'm through!
You know I'm better than you!
No, I won't let you win!
Not this time my friend
You know that I'm better In the end.
No, you won't take my pride!

Metal,"Hiroshima, A shadow burned in time
Nagasaki, naked baby melts alive
Burnt flesh and rubble from sea to dead shore
Such a hideous theatre of war
But that was the end--Why?
There are so many more that must die
Is that not part of the plan?
I must use the nukes
I can't kill you all with my hands

Hydrogen bomb, new signs of doom
Thermo-nuclear, neutron bomb too
You say these devices must never be used
I say you're mistaken, let's get to the fuse

Bring--Bring back the bomb
This is state policy, ""by other means""
Your life ends in terror, this is now decreed
This is the twisting of bloody steel beams
The bomb blows air backwards, there's no time to scream
When they tested the A-bomb, they had a real fear
The blast will destroy your sweet atmosphere
But far more important as power increases
Was wasting the planet in well-ordered pieces

Bring--bring back the bomb
Bring--bring--bring--bring back the bomb

Bring back the bomb
It's been far too long
Sumon the brazen war chariot
Bring back the bomb
what makes it so wrong?
Release the beast, you can't bury it

Hoi
Hrup [8x]

Why should the fire be shared with so few?
Let bombs explode, 'cause that's what they do
Nuke Mecca, New York, the Vatican too
Give me a bomb, I'll drop it on you
Why stop at only two?
You showed the world just what it can do
What a waste not to destroy
Come play at war, man, and bring your best toy

Who gives a fuck about a nuclear war?
Let bombs explode, because that's what they're for
Last minute warning, the sirens they sing
Chaos, the reason, death, what we bring

Humans now look to the sky!
You worship missiles, yet they know no side
I guess it was all a lie
So grab ass with both hands, it's your turn to die

Die--it's your turn to die [x2]
Lies--they killed you with lies
Die, human, die

And while we're at it, let's go nuke Tibet
Let's vaporize the oceans with glee
Saving the whales an agenda for some
Nuking them sits well with me
Bring back the bomb
They know not what they do
Bring--bring--bring back the bomb
Bring--bring-bring--bring back the bomb
Bring back the bomb
They know not what they do
Bring--bring--bring back the bomb
Bring--bring--bring--bring back the bomb

Bring back the bomb it's been far too long
Summon the brazen war chariot
Bring back the bomb

Release the beast, you can't bury it

carry on the flame
it's not over now
watch me
i will rise
time to reveal now
i know i will not fail
anymore
i'm the one forever
all that really matters
blessed realm
this world is sacred
i'm coming home
war
it's now or never
we shall stand together
one by one
this world is sacred
i'm coming home
yesterday's gone
there's no today
no tomorrow
i'm raised from the dead
the ritual failed
there at the gates
i'm left alone in this hour
driven insane
i am left alone
and now i drown in deepest shadows
while the golden hall is sealed
i'm wishing
i'm fading
and i'm part of the machine
my eyes are the eyes of a dead man
and feel the unholy stream
the source of my power
t-energy
i'm in control
i will live forever
all that really matters
blessed realm
this world is sacred
i'm coming home
war
it's now or never
we shall stand together
one by one
this world is sacred
i'm coming home
i spread my wings
but keep on falling
i should have known
i can see it coming
the war is over
there's whispering in the wind
just let me out of here
there is no way
there's no end
while all the suffering goes on
all that i know
is that i'm not insane
it's not over"
Metal,"My body's burning inside, I can't take this pain (anymore)... Look at me God!... Can't you see me? My flesh starts to rot, And my bones are deformed too... I am only infected, this is sordid... And my eyes can't see the truth! It's a morbid way to die, I don't deserve, What can I do?!... My suffer possesses me, Without mercy... My soul blessed be, Can it escape from this misery? This unholy sacrifice is very hard, Help me God, please!... I can't believe in truth, I really belong To the angel of disease I long for my time to come To be blest by death God, can I make a question? Why was I born? Maybe just to die... ""There's nothing left in this life for you... Apart from death... don't be afraid of it... Death is just a moment, during your soul Leaves your own body to the eternal life... Life..."" You are my master, I am your son... You'll take my soul, (And) we'll be as one... I don't want to escape, From the power that you create... So take me away, To the Devil's reign!... I can feel death, closer than before... I am going to die! Tears for what?! Life goes on Even after death! From the dark I see my Lord, He is calling me... To go next to him, it's time to close my eyes... So, please, bury me!..."
Metal,"In the morning 'bout three or so
Can't stop thinking about what I know
In the morning 'bout three or so
Can't stop thinking of the universe

I keep rocking, I keep rolling
Trade in the minute for a minute that isn't there
Keep dropping, keep rolling
Put out the fire with the water
Thinking creosote

I the morning with a beat up bud I know
I can't fight a war without losing blood

In the morning 'bout three or so
Can't stop seeking what I need to know
God is in the mountain as is in the rock
And god is not concerned about keeping stock

So keep rocking, keep rolling
Trade in the minute for a minute that isn't there
Keep dropping, keep rolling
Put out the fire with the water
Thinking creosote

All he ever wanted was to be alone
But you can't feel love without being loved

(Can't fight a war without losing blood)
(Blood, blood, blood)
All we ever wanted was love
Love! 
We can see the enemy, they say
Hey! we don't want your war
It's quite nice, white light, it's quite, it's quite extraordinary!
Window! It's a window! It's white! It's quiet, quiet
God, quiet! Just a little bit of quiet please

Just stop the noise for once,  please"
Metal,"I want to say I want to do better
I need to start a new life
First thing's to let go of the time that's passed us by
I'd like to be the one that you call for
When you're not sure what's right
Hope I'm not asking too much because I miss you

I watched you crawl, I made you suffer
I'm so sorry I let you down
I am coming home to you as fast as I can
This time I won't let you down no

How can I get back
It's been on my mind for far too long
I can never get it back
But if you would let me in I swear
I'll be a better man
I'm so sorry I wasn't there

I believe it's hard for you to picture
You and me and everything's nice
This time I'm going to make sure I'm always in your life
If it takes a little longer than we thought
For us to work this out
I hope at least you know I've always missed you

I watched you crawl, I made you suffer
I'm so sorry I let you down
I am coming home to you as fast as I can
This time I won't let you down no

How can I get back
It's been on my mind for far too long
I can never get it back
All the time I wasted
But if you would let me in I swear
I'll be a better man
I'm so sorry I wasn't there

I am coming home
I am coming home
This time I won't let you down I won't hurt you

How can I get back
It's been on my mind for far too long
I can never get it back
All the time I wasted it

I'll be a better man
I'm so sorry I wasn't there"
Metal,"The steel that sleeps the eye
Needs nor tax nor toll
The kings with men might lie
Swollen and halo'd

Her sweetest skin burns

Now I've buried all the gold beneath my hide
Now I'll swallow breath with blood

Of pole and anchor
Of stone and miter
Of god and beast and
Wine and fish and man

The virgin ground stains

Now we've wandered through the polestar's dusty floe
And my crown is breath and blood"
Metal,"The first time we met, our heaven was on fire 
My burning heart was aching, unfulfilled desire 
I'd been a fool in longing for your love 
The magic is gone, we 're livin' out of touch

Did you ever sing in the rain?
have you ever felt the pain?

Crossing the line on the edge of our time 
Searching for words, when truth hurts 
Our love was so strong, but now it s lost and gone 
Searching 'for words, when truth hurts

You're gone with the wind, leaving shadows of love 
Our whispering hearts were torn apart"
Metal,"Loose lips sink ships
So I'll keep silent
Suggest your words stay in your mouth
It's never ending
The cycles ascending
People keep asking
I'm not here

I don't really think
That you've ever walked a mile in my shoes
I don't really think
That you know what I've been through
What I've been through

All your life
I wish you would have learned
To swallow your pride

And stop preaching
I know what you're thinking
You're so far above me
In your mind
All the power and glory forever
We share this together I will never
I will remember what I've become

I'm finding out
The only thing left to lose is time
With all these doubts
The worst parts behind me

Don't forgive me
Please
I don't want this

Only when I'm back at home
I will
Only when I'm back at home
I will
Don't forgive me
I'll forget you
Write this on the wall

You don't know what I've been through
I've been through
I've been through"

i never really had a heart at all. bury you alive. and burn down the places you cherish most. you fuck. god damn i hope you burn inside

that i hurt you so bad

writing these songs about me. we were never supposed to be."
Metal,"Living risky, never scared, wander
Closer to the edge
Nothing valued think no fear, always
Wondering why you’re here
All your purposes are gone, nothing’s
Right and nothing’s wrong
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Feel no sorrow, feel no pain
Kiss me while I’m still alive
Kill me while I kiss the sky
Let me die on my own terms, let me
Live and let me learn
Now I’ll follow my own way, and i’ll
Live on to another damn day
Freedom carries sacrifice, remember when this was my life
Looking forward, not behind
Everybody’s got to cross that line
Free me now to give me a place,
Keep me caged and free the beast
Falling faster, time goes by, fear is
Not seen through these eyes
What there was will never be, now
I’m blind and cannot see
Kiss me while I’m still alive
Kill me while I kiss the sky
Let me die on my own terms, let me
Live and let me learn
Now I’ll follow my own way, and i’ll
Live on to another damn day
Freedom carries sacrifice, remember when this was my life
Kiss me while I’m still alive
Kill me while I kiss the sky
Let me die on my own terms, let me
Live and let me learn

You see the light through the dark
But you can't quite see through me

every breath that you faked

Let you go
You're the shore, I'm the tidal wave
I'm the reason you're coming up for air
Holding on to a memory
You can blame it on wishful sinking
You can blame it on wishful sinking
I'd try to save you
But what were you thinking?
So just breathe slow, caught in the undertow
And I'm fighting the current
Holding my ground if you can't let go
The pressure will hold you down
Remember when you said until the end
I swear I'll never feel the same again
You're the shore, I'm the tidal wave

It's so real in every way
Give God thanks and praise!

Just let my soul fly free
And let me be the one God wants me to be
Just let my soul fly free
And let me see everything I'm
Supposed to see

Just let my soul fly
Just let my soul fly free!

Armor that hides your thoughts for this eternity,
A clean break that will never heal.

Is this the pain that was felt everyday,

Now we both bleed, now we both die.

Now we both lose inside.
Now we both lose,
We've been here forty times and we still lose forty one times.
We still lose in the end, time to rise.

Every second of every hour.
Time to rise.
We all lose in the end.

I choose to lie in it
Live with my regrets
Sleep with what I said
Could this be the end
I'm standing on the edge
Of everything I wanted now….
But I was afraid
But I was afraid
Maybe I’m just scared
To face the things I fear
It’s easier to walk away from everything
Separate my soul
With all the things we shared
I’m falling to pieces now
Say a prayer for me (say a prayer for me)
When you go to bed
I’m in need of your faith now
But I was afraid
And maybe I’m just scared
To face the things I fear
It’s easier to walk away from everything
If we could just re-set
And live in happiness
Instead of our regrets
We would salvage everything
We don´t have to walk away
Pray for me now
I’m in need of faith
Pray for me now
I’m in need
Maybe I’m just scared
To face the things I feared
It’s easier to walk away from everything
If we could just reset
And live in happiness
Instead of our regrets
We´d salvage feared
Maybe I’m just scared
To face the things I failed
It’s easier to walk away from everything
Walk away from fear
Walk away from fear.

Metal,"Just remember to forget me
I hate this honestly
Please take this the wrong way
Dont need you to need me
I need you to disappear
Cause I carry ghosts
Of the things youve said
But you wont come home
Even if youre dead
Night after night
Sleepless in Phoenix
Tell me a lie
Make me believe it
You got me right where you haunt me
Night after night
Need you to know this
Tears me apart
I hope that youre hopeless too
Your pieces are right here
But nothing really fits
I want you to want me
Then watch me disappear
Cause I carry ghosts of the things you said
I lay my bones to rest
I know
We can kiss the past goodbye"

That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
Well it goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, then the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
And she tied you to a kitchen chair
And she broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, maybe there's a God above
But all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
Well it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not someone who's seen the light
It's a cold and broken Hallelujah

Sometimes I think that I'll never, (Can't) go on alone.

I can only paint deadly smiles on my poor face,
My poor face...

How could you leave us so suddenly?
How will we live?
How could you leave us so suddenly?
How will I live?

I'm so angry with you,
How could you
Hide your pain this way?

I'm so angry with myself,
How could I
Be so blind?

Every morning the same nightmare
Won't I wake up?
It's the worst pain I've ever felt:
You've given up, given up...

Because you hated life as life hated you.
Like a nameless disease, like an aimless torture.

I have searched for answers to explain your suicide.
I've preferred the version of an impulsive act.

But you knew all this time that you'd finally go.
You've prepared your own death with a smile on your lips.

We lost a friend,
(A) part of ourselves,
It will never be the same!

Something has died
With you this day
We're the orphans of your smiles!

How could you?

Metal,"The final curtain falls
When agony recalls
A touch of evil strikes
When life surrenders

Emerging emptiness
A banished soul to bless
My fading candle dies
When life surrenders

In twisted dreams my life will cease
The other side
My buried soul
In rotten soil
The end of time

The final curtain falls
When agony recalls
A touch of evil strikes
When life surrenders

The end of days arrive
When death replaces life
My judgment day - arise
When life surrenders"
Metal,"(From ""South Of Heaven"")
(Lyrics:Araya; Music: Hanneman, King)
 
Murder at your every foot step.
A child's toy sudden death.
Sniper blazes you through your knees
Falling down can you feel the heat,
Burn!
 
Ambushed by the spray of lead
Count the bullet holes in your head.
Offspring sent out to cry,
Living mandatory suicide.
Suicide. [x 4]

LEAD: HANNEMAN

Holes burn deep in your chest,
Raked by machine gun fire.
Screaming soul sent out to die,
Living mandatory suicide.
Suicide. [x 4]

LEAD: HANNEMAN
 
[Spoken:]
Lying, dying, screaming in pain.
Begging, pleading, bullets drop like rain.
Mines explode, pain sheers through your brain,
Radical amputation, this is insane.

Fly swatter stakes drive through your chest.
Spikes impale you as you're forced off the crest.
Soldier of misfortune
Hunting with bated breath.

A vile smell, like tasting death.
Dead bodies, dying and wounded
Litter the city streets
Shattered glass, bits of clothing and human deceit.
Dying [in] terror,
Blood's cheap, it's everywhere.
Mandatory suicide, massacre on the front line."
Metal,"It’s so depressing how you wag your tongue
And name with words as you please
I’m second guessing you’re the chosen one

Get out, I’m begging you please
You’re so excited to be
You’ve got me on my knees
Betray desire for me
But I’m giving up
Yea I’m giving up
As a confession you reach for your gun
And then cry a hole in my sleeve
It’s over-rated kissing you for fun
Now all I taste is the sleaze
You wear out, and lay claim to my mind
Get out, I’m begging you please
You’re so excited to be
You’ve got me on my knees
Betray desire for me

I hear no rescue squads They can't hear my silent screams Or does this have to be I deserve to die? Mi9's grown fate can't be stopped It's harvest time and I did invite the reaper to help me with the crop I used to be an observing satellite Sent here without a task Collecting images That I'd never supply When a lost satellite crashes and burns No one cries We only know our own world And can't do otherwise I blame no one But wish that I, on this ship Had dared to believe The navigator has always been me Under the debris There's still life but for how long? I hear no rescue squads They can't hear my silent screams"
Metal,"I guess there's only one place to go from here
I think the options are clear anyway

I´m sorry for making you wait for me
Cause I don't want to hold you down
But I don't want to set you free
I don't want to make you run from me
I guess it's hard to believe that I
Could make myself give up
After all this time you and me
Trying hard to make sense of our differences
Pretending we both had everything
I guess I believed in our fantasy
You only loved the one you wanted me to be
I´m sorry for breaking your faith in me
I don't want to hold you down
But what if you're more than I could please
Could you accept apologies?
I don't want to squander all your time
I don't want to mislead you
I think we both knew that it was done
Sorry I had to be the one
Sometimes I wish it were the other way around
I wish you weren't supposed to be
Set free"
Metal,"Fuck you all!
Running out of ways to run
I can't see, I can't be
Over and over and under my skin
All this attention is Doing Me In!
Fuck it all! Fuck this world!
Fuck everything that you stand for!
Don't belong! Don't exist!
Don't give a shit!
Don't ever judge me!
Picking through the parts exposed
Taking shape, taking shag
Over and over and under my skin
All this momentum is Doing Me In!
Fuck it all! Fuck this world!
Fuck everything that you stand for!
Don't belong! Don't exist!
Don't give a shit!
Don't ever judge me!
Don't you fucking judge me!
You got all my love, livin' in your own hate
Drippin' hole man, hard step, no fate
Show you nuthin', but I ain't holdin' back
Every damn word I say is a sneak attack
When I get my hands on you
Ain't a fucking thing you can do
Get this cuz you're never gonna get me
I am the very disease you pretend to be
I am the push that makes you move"
Metal,"you make me sick…
I’ll tear out those diamond eyes I can’t bear to see
crimson spills on paper skin…they call this tragedy
remembering the nights when you’d whisper to me soft,
“forever more my heart is yours”
realize those words have died
as the life fades from your eyes
all that I can say is it may not be too late
try again, make it perfect, make me worth it
or else die for all I care
if I can not be loved then none shall be
think of this as I softly kiss your blood glazed lips once more
on this night this thing you call love dies
your face disgusts me, smile and bear your lies
this broken trust will become your demise
as the life fades from your eyes
all that I can say is it may not be too late
try again, make it perfect, make me worth it
or else die for all I care
after today silence will haunt you
expect no forgiveness for your life will end tonight
now I grit my teeth and finish what I know must be done
to kill the memory of you…and you said this would be forever
as the life fades from your eyes
all that I can say is it may not be too late
try again, make it perfect, make me worth it
or else die for all I care

Like my scrotum here it is in a nutshell 
One thousand nine hundred and seventy-two 
That's the year I got here when my dear mother's water blew 
Not really realizing the prize that's been begot to her 
The bona fide lo-fi high-octane philosopher 
Genius with a penis the few the proud the me 
I liked me so much I had to buy the company 
Soul for sale sold to Satan for a hell of a lotta luck 
I'm hard to come by like a straight guy working at Starbucks 
Thank the thinkers that think they thunk the thoughts that theorized 
Idolized or despised bet I'm gettin' recognized 
Mount Rushmore it? No ignore it can't rock with no big head 
Half of the people want me half of the people want me dead 
I am the Angel of Def with my rhymes against humanity 
Teeter-tottering between brilliance and insanity 
The one part the Fuehrer the one part the Pope 
It's the inevitable return baby of the Great White Dope 

Conclusions you drew proportions you blew 
Lost son of Iggy? False Bigger nose than Ziggy? True 
Yes my name is Jimmy Pop no my pop's name is Dick 
Don't admit to kick it slick you thick derelict critic 
Put down for missed notes put up with misquotes 
Don't want the whole story? Should have bought the Cliff Notes 
Like Fingerpainting 101 give me no credit for having class 
One thumb on the pulse of the nation one thumb in your girlfriend's ass 
Written on written off scoff callin' me a joke 
I don't think that I'm a sell-out but I do ""Enjoy Coke!"" 
I struck gold but never took it for granite that's how I planned it so can it 
Around the planet fans demand it and you'll never understand it 
When I die no lie plan on mass pandemonium 
They may display my brain in a pickle jar at the Smithsonian 
The one part the Fuehrer the one part the Pope 
It's the inevitable return baby of the Great White Dope 

One part the Fuehrer one part the Pope 
The inevitable return of the Great White Dope 
One part the Fuehrer one part the Pope 
The inevitable return of the Great White Dope 
One part the Fuehrer one part the Pope 
The inevitable return of the Great White Dope 
One part the Fuehrer one part the Pope 
The inevitable return of the Great White Dope

Your vanity, black in grace

On raven wings, open up the clouds 
And heaven cries with you until the end of time
 
Mirrored in the moonlight

Metal,"Sittin' in a train when the moon shines bright
The rollin' stream lights up the night
I close my eyes and begin to dream
Just listening to the noise of the engine's stream
The engine's stream

In a murderous heat I wake up
Afraid I realize the train won't stop
I'm sceared - my panic rises more and more
When I read the golden letters on my compartment door

Heaven's 7th train - no way back again
Hear the nightnares yell
In the train of your farewell
Of your farewell

Am I alive or am I dead?
Can I belive what I just read?
A prisoner of this rollin' cell
Am I in a dream on my way straight to hell?

Heaven's 7th train - no way back again
Hear the nightnares yell
In the train of your farewell
Of your farewell
Of your farewell
Or your farewell

Heaven
Heaven
Heaven - 7th
Heaven
Heaven
Heaven - 7th

Heaven's 7th train - no way back again
No tales left to tell
In the train of your farewell
Of your farewell
Of your farewell
Of your farewell

In to my life of nothing
Sick of the same ol' thing,
so I dig a hole and bury the pain
Sick of the same ol' thing,
so I dig a hole and bury the pain
I am so high,always
Burying my life so slowly
Chorus
It opens my mind to feelings
Can't face bottom without something
Chorus
We enter in my head
Feeling like I'm God
With the world around me
Can't you feel this pain
reaming throught my heart
screaming throught my veins
nothing I can kill
The stinging of my heart,aah
Can't you feel my heart,ahh
Can't you take my heart...away
Tired heart
Goodbye

With this dagger, I kill the leper
Accuser of all, I the rapture

Deceiver, your mental abortion
Deceiver, your terminal cancer
Deceiver, a slave to your master"

And I rise in every occasion

""You want to know where you are? Ha! Ha! Ha! Haaa! In Port Royal!!""


Hundred masts, thirty flags
An island in the gulf of Darien
Sandglass, bloody heart
Flying high above the scene

Marooners with loaded guns
Are still waiting at the quay
A hungry fleet from underworld
""Freedom"" is the law they pray

""Black strap"", rum and gin
Sexual freedom all the way
A rolling dice, an ace of hearts
One shall win and one's to pay

Concord and freedom
No need for the holy write
Rebellions, non-servile
Spitting on religious hypocrites

Port Royal
A cry of freedom on the sea

When the ""Oxford"" hits the sea
Slave driver learns the Moses law
There is no chance, they can't escape
They hunt them down and eat 'em raw

Gin Lane, New Providence
It all is now since along time gone
But there are still descendants
Port Royal's spirit lives forever on

Port Royal
A cry of freedom on the sea."
Metal,"Scarred, emotion infiltrates my soul. 
Suffer, the hierarchy takes control. 
Insane, no matter where you run you die. 
Breaking the chain. 

In your eyes I see a void. 
Pain, the depths of terror spent. 
Haste, your friend when no-one cares, 
A wraith of evanescent hope. 

In your eyes I see a void. 
Pain, the depths of terror spent. 
Take this chance to fight or die. 
I can taste your fucking lies. 
Scream, Bleed, Dream, Fail. 
Free from torture, recite the pain, did you like it? 
Are you proud? 
It wasn't what you thought it was gonna be."
Metal,"A birth that came from more than sound
Now rages on from town to town
A giant grows more every day
And now the maniac is here to stay

A feeling you can't kill
It's the power, it's a will
Controls your thoughts but you can't see

Just when you thought it safe he suddenly appears
He feels no pain, he has no mercy or no fears
He gives the message and your mind is filled with glue
And now the maniac lives inside of you

He's back. 
The suicidal maniac.

Each day he grows more and more
He's bigger now than ever before
His thoughts he'll compromise on never
He can't be stopped. 
He'll live forever

Blast away through the mind
A power of another kind
A presence that is growing out of sound

And now it's come, the time the maniac I'll meet
He takes my hand and now I bow down to his feet
His love for me is like a father to a son
And now the maniac and I are one

I bow to his might
Too powerful to fight
And it's my destiny
Now the maniac lives inside of me

He's back. 
The suicidal maniac.

An army at his command
A strength that you can't comprehend
A force unknown can now be told
The power of the world he holds

A feeling you can't kill
It's the power, it's the will
Controls your thoughts but you can't see

Just when you thought it safe he suddenly appears
He feels no pain, he has no mercy or no fears
He gives the message and your mind is filled with blue
And now the maniac's a part of you

And the time has come. The maniac you'll meet
He takes your hand and now you bow down to his feet
His love for you is like a father to a son
And now the maniac and you are one

He's back. 
And it's the suicidal maniac."

Tips are jocked, jaws are clocked, we sit back and laugh
Spitting bloody chicklets, veins are bulging from their throat

Trying to express your rage
You must use your fists
Personality dissolves in a

Repeat the past as you've always before
Reap it, want no part of your lies
Keep your mistruthts and remove you from sight

Guilty from the start of the game

Hatred has you trapped in its womb
Never will I have compassion for you

And you!
I am me and I do anything that I please
Unforgiven, you're a waste of one's time to this servant of hell
You're confused if you thought I was loyal and true

My decision to undo what is done and forever hate you

Metal,"Always, always and forever
Always, always and forever
I'm sitting here I'm thinking back to a time when I was young
My memory is clear as day
I'm listening to the dishes clink
You were downstairs
You would sing songs of praise
And all the times we laughed with you
And all the times that you stayed true to us
Now we’ll say...
I said I thank you, I'll always thank you
More than you will know, than I could ever show
And I love you, I'll always love you
There's nothing I won't do, to say these words to you
That you're beautiful forever
Always, always and forever
You were my mom, you were my dad
The only thing I ever had was you, it's true
Even when the times got hard
You were there to let us know that we'd get through
You showed me how to be a man
You taught me how to understand the things people do
You showed me how to love my God
You taught me that not everyone knows the truth
And I thank you, I'll always thank you
More than you will know, than I could ever show
And I love you, I'll always love you
There's nothing I won't do, to say these words to you
That you will live forever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
I said I thank you, I'll always thank you
More than you will know, than I could ever show
And I love you, I'll always love you
There's nothing I won't do, to say these words to you
That I thank you, I'll always thank you
More than you will know, than I could ever show
And I love you, I'll always love you
There's nothing I won't do, to say these words to you
That you will live forever"
Metal,"I'm sorry
For something I didn't do
Lynched somebody
But I didn't know who

You blame me
For slavery
A hundred years before I was born

[Repeat: x4]
Guilty of being white 

I'm sorry
For something I didn't do
Lynched somebody
But I didn't know who

[Repeat: x4]
Guilty of being white 

I'm convicted
Of a racist crime
I've only served
19 years of my life

I'm sorry
For something I didn't do
Lynched somebody
But I didn't know who

Guilty of being white 

Guilty of being right"

Metal,"Tension is what you look for
What you crave and what you live for, but couldn`t find
The power it will provide and give you
Is enough for a mortal man

Cast life into fire
This is the end my friend
There is no way turning back
Once you shoot up, then you give up
There is no need to come and cry

Do you see, the fading image of me
Can I believe, that your story is true
What do you want
There is nothing here, except a path and the end

Imagine a life without it
You could never have existed your own way
But since you chose this
Then know that the demons are for real

Cast life into fire
This is the end my friend
There is no way turning back
Once you shoot up, then you give up
There is no need to come and cry

Do you see, the fading image of me
It`s the last you will see
The answer to all your questions
Is right here beside you if you would open your eyes

With the morbid knowledge
That you threw your life away
Would you stand before a jury
And admit you`re a looser, a goddamn fool

What did you get out of your short tragic life
And the friends you left behind
Once you shut up, then you give up
There is no way back for you

Do you see, the fading image of me
Can I believe, that your story was true
What did you want
There was nothing here, except a path and the end"
Metal,"There was a time, I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home, I was a queen I had a golden throne
Those days are gone, now the memories are on the wall
I hear the songs from the places where I was born
Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!
There was a time, I met a boy of a different kind
We ruled the world, thought I'll never lose him out of sight
We were so young, I think of him now and then
I still hear the songs, reminding me of a friend
Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!
Ooh ooh ooh oh!
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!
Ooh ooh ooh oh!"
Metal,"I never knew that a kid like me
Could take his mic around the world
And flash the big sd
And rock the masses
From madrid to calabasses
Tijuana, mexico
Bootleg demos in tokyo
They know me though
Cause I be puttin work
Commit my life to rebirth
Well respected
Cause that's my word
I'm sure you heard
About a new sound going around
She might have left my hood
But she was born in my town

You didn't know that we was new on the scene
Well it's alright it's alright!
I know you know
I see you smiling at me
Well it's alright it's alright!

Here comes the boys from the south

We rep
The south
So what you talking abou
I'm not running off my moth
I know this without a doubt
Cause if you know these streets
Then these streets know you
When it's time to handle business
Then you know what to do
Me and my crew
We stay true old skool or new
Many were called
But chosen are few
We rise to the top
What you want?
Just in case you forgot
Rush to the stage
Grab my mic
Show me what you got!

Is that all you got?
I'l take your best shot

Metal,"hear my call don't waste your time
remember what we're fighting for
hear my voice take my hand
we've got to win this war
we were meant to be free
not to live in slavery
to the other galaxie we go
gather all our strength before they know
soon the time will come for all of us
to unite our souls and hearts
save the universe"
Metal,"As this eternal struggle has come to end The light of life now shines upon us once again But can we truly be free of tyranny and grief? I see a thousand points of light reaching for me Now nature grows and blooms and people live again Yet this is not the end, I feel it This power given to me is more than I can bear Unbidden flowing through my mind Divine it is but it could ruin this world I see a thousand points of light reaching for me Now nature grows and blooms and people live again Yet this is not the end, I fear it I am the one to end this game This world will never be the same I have the power in my hands The time has come to save all life I'll do what it takes, no more lies I'll choose the destiny of Dragonland A thousand points of light The madness now have to end I am yet to destroy the ones The gods responsible for this A thousand points of light My final quest is at hand To let people live their lives in peace Without gods and without me With great reluctance I reached into the light I rise up to the skies enraged and full of might They stand before me radiating azure-blue I'll fight them till the end, yes, that's what I must do And I shall rid this world of gods to rule our lives So now the end is here, I know it With all my force I strike them down They scream in anguish as they drown In fire they now turn to sand They beg for mercy, I give none My live is over, my quest done I've saved all living here in Dragonland A thousand points of light The madness now, it has end I've yet to become one with All one with universe A thousand points of light Dragonland is at peace A thousand points of light Is reaching for me"
Metal,"The light in the window is a crack in the sky
A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye
A levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back
The man in the dark will bring another attack

Your mamma told you that you're not supposed to talk to strangers
Look in the mirror and tell me do you think your life's in danger here

No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears

Another day passes as the night closes in
The red light goes on to say it's time to begin

I see the man around the corner waiting, can he see me?
I close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here

No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears

It's just a sign of the times
Going forward in reverse
Still, these were our first
Its just a hand in the bush
A hand in the bush

So now that it's over can't we just say good-bye? (bye-bye, bye-bye)
I'd like to move on and make the most of the night
Maybe a kiss before I leave you this way
Your lips are so cold I don't know what else to say

I never wanted it to end this way my love, my darling
Believe me when I say to you in love I think
I'm falling here

No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears
No more tears, tears, tears

It's just a hand in the bush

Metal,"From all the things that wait for you 
The blood, tears the destruction 
The loss, the mourning and the shocks 
That fate still has in store 
No magic, no man made belief 
Can change your life's cruel journey 
And one cursed minute takes away 
All pleasures from before 

Hand of fate is stronger than us 
Bringing pain, bringing sorrow 
Crashing down, in a split second change 
One evil comes a million follow 

Never safe from what will be 
Things come as they shall come 
From first to last all misery 
You're dealt with cruel cards 
As tortured fear grabs your heart 
Fate seems to laugh out loud 
Wasting life, doubting all 
And counting all the scars 

Hand of fate is stronger than us 
Bringing pain, bringing sorrow 
Crashing down, in a split second change 
One evil comes a million follow 

Though things won't be the same 
It's all part of the game 
Nothing is left to chance 
When fate is dictating the end"
Metal,"You take a mortal man
And put him in control
Watch him become a god
Watch peoples heads a'roll
A'roll
(Chorus)
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony
Of Destruction
Acting like a robot
Its metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse
Before the head explodes
Explodes

Solo - Marty
The earth starts to rumble
World powers fall
A'warring for the heavens
A peaceful man stands tall
Tall

Metal,"Nothing suffocates you more than the passing of everyday human events
And isolation is the oxygen mask you make your children breath into survive
But i'm not a slave to a god that doesn't exist
I'm not a slave to a world that doesn't give a shit
And when we were good
You just closed your eyes
So when we are bad
We'll scar your minds
fight, fight, fight, fight
You'll never grow up to be a big-rock-star-celebrated-victim-of-your-fame
They'll just cut our wrists like cheap coupons
And say that death was on sale today
And when we were good
You just closed your eyes
So when we are bad
We'll scar your minds
But i'm not a slave to a god that doesn't exist
I'm not a slave to a world that doesn't give a shit
The death of one is a tragedy (x3)
The death of a million is just statistic
(chorus)
fight, fight, fight, fight
But i'm not a slave to a god that doesn't exist
I'm not a slave to a world that doesn't give a shit
But i'm not a slave to a god that doesn't exist

Metal,"Movin' down the back streets
Pass the speed of light
Sparks burn inside me
Gas and air adjusted right
Layin' down some rubber
Needle's in the red

I'm blowin' away
On the edge

Never ceasing, never ending
My machine's what I live for
Don't ever try to pass me
Cause I'll even up the score
Cool, and lean and righteous
Slipping through the air

I play for keeps
But won't play fair

And I'm street, street lethal
Poundin' down the back roads
Higher than a steeple
Street, street lethal
Come and watch me ride

Movin' down the pavement
Don't get in my hair
Exploding in your faces
Like a match to liquid air
Bolting down the back straights
Spilling round the curves

I'll give you all
Your just desserts

One explosion then another
Feeling it excel
Put the road behind me
Keep my feet out of hell
Pulling up into the heavens
Blowing past a shooting star

First I'm near
Then I'm far

And I'm street, street lethal
Poundin' down the back roads
Higher than a steeple
Street, street lethal
Come and watch me ride

On this four wheel heart attack
Customized to cut no slack

And I'm street, street lethal
Poundin' down the back roads
Higher than a steeple
Street, street lethal
Come and watch me ride

Street, street lethal
Poundin' down the back roads
Higher than a steeple
Street, street lethal
Come and watch me
Ride"

I never strayed too far from you
Forever by your side
No matter what I was going through

When will I find where I fit in?
I hate this town
what a world, come on never bring me down
Everything I had is turning back around
Cause our times were something
Bigger than both you and me
I can't live my life always backing down
I've gotta do this right and they can't make a sound
Cause I'm not here for nothing
‘Least I can say I stand for something
You and me we stand for something

Was it everything they told you?
Was it all the things they promised you?
Was it everything they told you?
Was it everything they said it would be?

Strange things move in the corner of my eyes
And the sky never looked so white and pretty
Tiny figures crawl upon my sterile flesh
There's a hole in the world, and it keeps getting bigger

Was it everything you hoped for?
Was it all the things you prayed for?
Was it everything you hoped for?
Was it everything you thought it would be?

How can you love it...
How can you believe it...
How can you need it...
When there's nothing there?
In space where the stars are dead now
The man in the moon still has a wicked face
But the more you reach for the heavens above
The more you'll hate your own pitiful love

Like a river flowing around me...mirrors paradise
Pulling me in its wake... mirrors paradise

How can you love it...
How can you believe it...
How can you need it...
When there's nothing there?
I want to show you something so much better
I'll make the world seem a little bit deader

Pulling me in its wake... mirrors paradise"

Once lost
Lost in their game

That I get what I deserve

So give me reason / to prove me wrong / to wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
Give me reason / to fill this hole / connect the space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

There was nothing in sight / but memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide / the ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in / between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason / to prove me wrong / to wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

In every loss / in every lie
In every truth that you'd deny
And each regret / and each goodbye
Was a mistake to great to hide
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

Invisible turning the fragile
Unbreakable

They cannot take away
What I believe
You cannot take away
Cannot take away
What's underneath

Masked in my tomorrow
Bringing wisdom that I need for all the time I borrow
My other side is left behind
Out of reach

Casting a shadow, a blinding black

Time after time, unneeded misery
Holding tight to my dreams
I own no price for you
I grip them tight and hope for sight.

Open my eyes wide to see a moment of clarity
Confusion gone, it's in your hands
Your turn to ask why.

Life is like a mystery
With many clues, but with few anwers
To tell us what it is that we can do to look
For messages that keep us from the truth"

We live in your game
Your days getting closer
And all love completely erased
We run from the plague
That you keep right beside you
So close to you

Something that'll take me on a ride
To all the familiar places
But still a good place to hide

So not worth it

(So close to you!)"
Metal,"If you take a step towards me
You will take my breath away
So I'll keep you close and keep my secret safe
No one else has ever loved me
No one else has ever tried
I never understood how much I could take
Then I saw the worst was over
When I laid my eyes on you
It was all that I could do to know my place
Out of all the vast illusions
Out of all the dreams come true
I was gone until I finally saw your face
If you cried out for more
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm
Just to keep you here with me
I have gone beyond my years
I've wasted half my life
But I found it all in you
Did I save you?
'Cause I know you saved me too
Let me take a step towards you
Let me feel you in my hands
Let me cross this line and show you where it leads
There's a darkness down inside me
That I know we'll both enjoy
And its screaming from within to set it free
I have left this bloody nightmare
In my wake, but out of sight
All I want is deviation by design
Out of all the past confusion
Out of all the common spite
Just tell me I am yours cause you are mine
And if you cried out for more
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm
Just to keep you here with me
I have gone beyond my years
I've wasted half my life
But I found it all in you
Did I save you?
'Cause I know you saved me too
It doesn't really matter what you do or say
I'm never going anywhere anyway
Cause when I'm dying for you
I've never felt so alive

If you cried out for more
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm
Just to keep you here with me
I have gone beyond my years
I've wasted half my life
But I found it all in you
Did I save you?
'Cause I know you saved me too
I know you saved me too"
Metal,"We tha land of carnival and murder 
Bring tha drums and the sounding of thunder 
Oh my people, we got to get stronger 
With the spirit of war in Quilombos

Jungle people jungle 
Never underestimate our power 
Jungle people jungle 
Never underestimate our power 

Bring our roots, we're under the sun 
From in the jungle and from the slums 
Our freedom we bring with this song 
Never forget where you came from! 

Bumba! Bumba! 

Oxossi open my way 
I'm gonna tell the world what you say
I know God making me a way 
We pray, we pray, we pray everyday"
Metal,"We are forced to live in silence
Eating dust and breathing violence
Keeping all the suffering within
Let me be the one to hold you
Trying hard, reamining hopeful
Making sure
Your heart is free of sin
In mother's scorn
Blood was born
Where we belong
Our nation's torn
Passage gone
A war unknown to us all
Waiting to see your conviction
Swallowing proud premonitions
Clinging onto hope
That slowly dies
Standing in the ruing of nature
Caused by forces born from danger
Cleaning hands where virtues live on ice
In mother's scorn
Blood was born
A war unknown to us all
See the rays of light dance in hurricanes
The essence of our life
Held within cruel chains
Come and see the day's unsolved history
The mirrors in the eyes
Are reflecting the fear
We can't hide cruel commands
We will see their last stand
From the heart where we belong
Forever blind to the wasteland beyond
Find security
In this misery
Build a world of death
Hear the fallen prey
In the fire we've ignited
Thoughts of slaying dreams
In the ashes evil is reborn
Your mortality
Is the highest prize
Your mind's intricate
In a labyrinth turned inside out
In mother's scorn
Blood was born
Where we belong
Our nation's torn
Passage gone
A war unknown to us all
See the rays of light dance in hurricanes
The essence of our life
Held within cruel chains
Come and see the day's unsolved history
The mirrors in the eyes
Are reflecting the fear
See the sands of time play with prophecies
We always end up losing to life's guarantee
Barren promises feed on your demise
The challenge to be free is a lost enterprise
We can't hide cruel commands
We will see their last stand
From the heart where we belong
Yet we all know
Why the cruel commandments came along
Forever blind to the wasteland beyond"
Metal,"This beat is my recital 
I think it's very vital 
To rock a rhyme 
That's right on time 
It's tricky tricky yo here we go 

It's tricky to rock a rhyme 
To rock a rhyme that's right on time 
It's tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky 

It's tricky to rock a rhyme 
To rock a rhyme that's right on time 
It's tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky 

I met this little girlie, her hair was kind of curly 
Went to her house to bust her out, I had to leave real early 
These girls are really sleazy, all they just say is please me 
Or spend some time and rock a rhyme, I said it's not that easy 

It's tricky to rock a rhyme 
To rock a rhyme that's right on time 
It's tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky 
It's tricky to rock a rhyme 
To rock a rhyme that's right on time 
It's tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky 

In New York the people talk and try to make us rhyme 
They really hawk, but we just walk, because we have no time 
And in the city it's a pity, 'cause we just can't hide 
Tinted windows don't mean nothing, they know who's inside 

It's tricky to rock a rhyme 
To rock a rhyme that's right on time 
It's tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky 
It's tricky to rock a rhyme 
To rock a rhyme that's right on time 
It's tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky 

When I wake up people take up mostly all of my time 
I'm not singing, phone keep ringing so I make up a rhyme 
I'm not bragging, people nagging, 'cause they think I'm a star 
Always tearing what I'm wearing, I think they're going too far 
A girl named Tara follows Jared every gig we play 
Evil dissed her and dismissed her, now she's jocking Spanky 
I ain't lying, girls be crying, 'cause we're on TV 
They even bother my poor father, 'cause he's down with me 

It's tricky to rock a rhyme 
To rock a rhyme that's right on time 
It's tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky 
It's tricky to rock a rhyme 
To rock a rhyme that's right on time 
It's tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky tricky 

We are not dumb, we don't use drugs, but you assume on your own 
They offer coke and lots of dope, but we just leave it alone 
It's like that y'all, but we don't quit 
You keep on, rock shot, 'cause this is it."
Metal,"Today I'll start a zine, my views will change the scene Everything that I write, will surely change their minds. First I will make them laugh, and make them want to read My reviews are excellent, interviews are in-depth! Pictures are glossy, and a list of shows. Now I have to sell some ads, so I can make some cash. Production run is now complete, first issue is out. Now I will spread the word, to gain praise of the hard work I have done. Copies are moving fast, issue one is sold out! Promos are piling in, labels want to advertise Go to shows to promote. Everyday life is getting better, with a shot of beer. Hanging out with the bands I love to hear. On the phone with label reps, boy this life is the best! Working harder, more hours everyday Magazine is improving in every way. Punctuation is now complete, vocabulary expanded, They love the new me. A few years go by, and still I write. This magazine consumes my life. Always looking for the next big thing. The scene kind of suck. Life is all the same, But still I try to satisfy the readers who subscribe! Every hour dissipates from me. My computer keeps freezing up! Deadlines suck, contributors take forever, Another metal fest, there's never anywhere to sit! Dealing with accountants about bounced checks. Or being bribed for a good review If I speak my mind you won't like what I've got to say. Same old job, same old house. My life is redundant."
Metal,"I'm such an asshole
god I'm such a stain 
I just keep fucking up again and again
you crawled inside my mind 
when you crawled into my bed 
said everything I've ever longed to hear 
so perfect, so alive, 
once inside you sucked me dry 
you used me up and left me here for dead 
I crave it desperately, a cancer eating me 
an addiction too intense to be denied worthless, 
I'm a whore, crawling back for more 
it's pathetic how I feed off this abuse 
you told me that you love me and 
I believed you loved me 
but you swore that you loved me and I believed... 
now I know it was a lie 
I don't believe 
I don't believe that I could be so stupid and so naive 
I don't believe 
I don't believe that there is nothing, nothing left for me

you're still half asleep

shrouded beneath a veil of tragedy
when death comes calling
who will you believe?
tell me who will you believe
when it's down to you and me
will you still stay on your knees?
there's no one coming
and there's no way out
i've been falling

Metal,"I'm back in town where I was born,
Where street's so cold and heart's of stone.

They told me, kid, you'll see the sun.
I did! through the barrel of the gun

Day one I understood the game,
So much to loose, so much to gain.

I'm not the one who's left behind,
I know I'll make it, through the night

Somebody's gonna die in a desperate fight,
No use to hide away the light.
Get paid to go so far, no matter who you are.
Nobody's gonna run and there's no one to blame,
We're under the gun and feel no shame,
It's never gonna end, the legion of the damned

I've listened to preachers, I've listened to fools,
So many saints, so many rules

It's gonna be, cold day in hell,
If ever reason'll break the spell.

Somebody's gonna die in a desperate fight,
No use to hide away the light.
Get paid to go so far, no matter who you are.
Nobody's gonna run and there's no one to blame,
We're under the gun and feel no shame,
It's never gonna end, the legion of the damned

They don't understand,
I know who I am"
Metal,"Up from the ashes of despair and loss
Years of enslavement now come with a higher cost
Bureaucracy you chose to rule with fear
Now feel the wrath that comes from all those years

You choose to shut your eyes
Now repent

Rise of the fallen
Suffer the hand you dealt yourself
Rise of the fallen
The fallacy of fractured wealth
Rise of the fallen
Ignore the parts of your machine
Rise of the fallen
Drink from the fountain of your poisoned dream

Destroy the world and all the wars we're on
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust will come
I the destroyer of both worlds
Born from the womb of insult I come

You chose to shut your eyes
Now repent
You chose to shut your eyes
Now repent

Rise of the fallen
Suffer the hand you dealt yourself
Rise of the fallen
The fallacy of fractured wealth
Rise of the fallen
Ignore the parts of your machine
Rise of the fallen
Drink from the fountain of your poisoned dream

Drink from the fountain of your poisoned dream
Bled from your machine
Choke on the spirits that you tried to eat
Now on you they feed
You build the part; now you play it
We become the master
Drown in all the laughter
Law from below; now you obey it
Death comes never faster
This is the disaster"
Metal,"Out here alone, I will wear a thousand faces
I'm still waiting, the master of disguise
Can't you hear me calling in my deepest desperation

I talked to the angles, cause I'd broken every rule
And if you hurt me, there's a way back to you
I found a reason out in this mystery

A touch of heaven
I opened up my soul
Don't leave me waiting
Until my heart is gone

It takes two times
There's no holding back now
Until I found you again
Tears of rage

Into the real world we said our last goodbye
Betrayed ourselves only for our selfish pride
I'm disillusioned, threw my heart into the flame

A touch of heaven
I opened up my soul
Don't leave me waiting
Until my heart is gone

It takes two times
There's no holding back now
Until I found you again
Tears of rage

Five in the morning, I'd lied to myself
Time to surrender as I see your face
I just want to hold you
I could make you mine again

A touch of heaven
I opened up my soul
Don't leave me waiting
Until my heart is gone

It takes two times
There's no holding back now
Until I found you again

It takes two times
There's no holding back now
Until I found you again
Tears of rage
Tears of rage"
Metal,"Sands in the hourglass fall for us all
You don't answer me anymore when I call
So much is trapped inside, tangled in your brain
It's getting cold outside and it looks like rain
The sky is falling and my heart is caving in
So, now the time has come to say the long goodbye
The setting of the sun reflection in your eyes
Day after day after day the world will pass you by
You forget to remember
If this is living, what the hell is living for?
You've boarded up your eyes, your mind has locked the door
I'm just a stranger now with an unfamiliar face
You can't recall me at all
There's not a trace..
Not a trace..
not a trace
I don't know where you are and my world is crumbling in
So, now the time has come to say the long goodbye
The setting of the sun reflection in your eyes
Day after day after day the world will pass you by
You forget to remember
I just want to talk - what do you want?
But you've nothing to say - leave me alone
I beg you to come - get away from me
And you just walk away - I have no idea who you are!
I curse the day that your smile fades away, till then I pray
A burning candle in-between and at both ends
With all that we've learned, yet we still pretend
I just wish you could say my name again
They made the lock and broke the key
The culprit was the mercury
The vaccine wipes your memories
Till you forget even how to breathe
A tangled web they weave, when they practice to deceive
So, now the time has come to say the long goodbye
The setting of the sun reflection in your eyes
Day after day after day the world will pass you by
I said that I'd be strong, but you know I had to lie
You forget to remember..
It's time to say the long goodbye"
Metal,"How do you let someone know 
If your hot cakes are selling well?"
Metal,"Don't bless me Father for I have sinned
Father, did you miss me?
I've been locked up a while
I got caught for what I did
But took it all in style
Laid to rest all my confessions
I gave way back when
But now I'm versed in so much worse
So I am back again
And he said
For the lines that I take, I'm going to hell
For the love that I make, I'm going to hell
Getting heavy with the devil
You can hear the wedding bells
Father, did you miss me?
Don't ask me where I've been
You know I know, yes I've been told
I redefine sin
And I don't know what's driving me
To put this in my head
Maybe I wish I could die, maybe I am dead
And he said
For the lives that I fake, I'm going to hell
For the vows that I break, I'm going to hell
For the ways that I hurt, while I'm hiking up my skirt
I am sitting on a throne
While they're buried in the dirt
For the man that I hate, I'm going to hell
Getting heavy with the devil
You can hear the wedding bells
Please, forgive me Father
I didn't mean to bother you
The devil's in me, Father
He's inside of everything I do
For the life that I take, I'm going to hell
For the laws that I break, I'm going to hell
For the love that I hate, I'm going to hell
For the lies that I make, I'm going to hell
For the way I condescend and never lend a hand
My arrogance is making
This head buried in the sand
For the souls I forsake, I'm going to hell
Getting married to the devil
You can hear the wedding bells"
Metal,"That's the phone that I had when you were mine
In those days it was ringing all the time
Calling you so I knew you were fine
And a good man I felt that I could be
I was strong, full of hope and dignity
But the break, that mistake came from me
I know you, you know me
Why we aren't together is a mystery
That only we know, we know
All I want to do is be together with you and let you know
I'll be a good man
All I want to do is be together with you and never go
I'll be a good man
Every night I can see you in my dreams
But my days are so empty and it seems
Being wrong takes so long to remedy
And I've tried taking everyone's advice
Just move on, get back in and roll the dice
But the song I sing in my head is ""Wouldn't it be nice""
I know you, you know me
Why we aren't together is a mystery
That only we know, we know
All I want to do is be together with you and let you know
I'll be a good man
All I want to do is be together with you and never go
And I've tried taking everyone's advice
Just move on, get back in and roll the dice

Metal,"We're rolling down the highway
I'm rolling down my window
Then I stick my hand out
And fly with it as it flows

If I started thinking
Instead of looking back
You wouldn't see me sinking
Before they covered up the cracks

This is what it feels like, coming down
We're all in the movie, can't turn it off or shut it down
This is what it feels like, if that's so
Then where is the director to tell us where the hell to go?

I've got this film in my head
It's scripted all that I've said
Let's make it of real before we're dead
Because we're

Close enough, we're diamonds in the rough
Today's the day we finally say
Can't turn this movie off

And if we're told, we might as well
Just blow this all to hell
It's not a film or a fantasy
We're not just make believe

This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like

So this is what it feels like
Running through my lines
I'm never the pretender
I find it's just a waste of time

This is what it feels like
When the hero dies
On to the next one
Funny how time flies

I've got this film in my head
It's scripted all that I've said
Let's make it real before we're dead
Because we're

Close enough, we're diamonds in the rough
Today's the day we finally say
Can't turn this movie off

And if we're told, we might as well
Just blow this all to hell
It's not a film or a fantasy
And we're not just make believe
It's not a film or a fantasy
We're not just make believe

As long as I play me
And as long as you play you
God, I love this scene
I gotta thank the cast and crew
Don't let the credits roll
Don't let the credits roll

Because we're close enough
We're diamonds in the rough
Today's the day we finally say
Can't turn this movie off

And if we're told, we might as well
Just blow this all to hell
It's not a film or a fantasy
And we're not just make believe

It's not a film or a fantasy
And we're not just make believe
It's not a film or a fantasy
We're not just make believe

Metal,"Psychosis warfare
In deepest tombs
Our helpless saviors
Divide our minds in half
Brightless human
Mind left blank
Empty landscape
Runs a sword in thee
Utopia gone inside our selves
For nothing we feed our darkest thoughts

Distant shallows swarms our inner truths
Obliteration frames our naked walls
And stains our memory more
Breathe your enemy
Loose your sane
Target midways
Follows with watching eyes
Heartless movement
Breathless room
Darkened worlds
Flamed inside our cells"

maddened eyes with fright
fingers bleeding fast heart beating

we will raise the dead
we will raise the dead
stop at nothing raise the dead
Gaze across the blackened yard
my mind is filled with dread
so give me all the powers of Hell
and I'll raise the dead
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The hotter the fire, the greater the lust

[CHORUS:]
I hear the star of the Necromancer
my blood is black and my heart doth bleed
I am infernal and my mind's in torment
I'll raise the dead make the world unclean

Laughing as my legions rise
control the zombies mind
I hold Hell close to my breast
I'm leaving God behind
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
I'll enter hellfire, I'll break the crust

No more, I can't take it
No more, What do we stand for

I'm feeling razor sharp riding on the cutting edge.
I'm going back and forth raging like a lunatic
I'm going to do things like never before
Take the key and open the door
Break the rules my will is my way
Light my fuse I'm coming back for more
Take the life that runs in your veins and flow!
Don't look back. or you'll fall
Don't slow down... no not at all...

Look in his eyes
Hellraiser
Don't be surprised!
I'm feeling energized tantalized electrified
I'm going to find a way; live it up and take what's mine.
And if I have to abuse and destroy
Lt's ok that's most of the joy!
Break the rules my will is my way
Light my fuse I'm coming back for more.
Take the life that runs in your veins and flow
Don't look back... or you'll fall
Don't slow down no not at all

Metal,"Searching, for the truth, dismissing, dismissing these lies of my youth. 
It's time, to get 'em back, this ways ain't working and that's a fact. 
This world, has lost its way, lost its mind- in disarray. 
I'm trapped in disbelief, of a modern world, in misery. 

Searching for the truth, in the age of lies. 
Searching for the truth, in the age of lies. 
Progression, regression, it's all the same, if our progress is done in vain. 
We're living and dying in an age of doubt, and there's not much time to figure it out. 

And we can't give in. Bow down- humanity. 
Gotta find a way, or face insanity. 
Searching for the t ruth, in the age of lies. 
Searching for the truth, in the age of lies. 
Searching, for the truth, dismissing, dismissing these lies of my youth. 

It's time, we get 'em back, this ways ain't working and that's a fact"
Metal,"Here, I wait for a good thing to resolve
When I'm sinking in a ship I can't control
And I'm sick with a smile I try and hide
Broken pieces of a lie, I can't let go
I never meant to let you down again
I had it all but watched it drown
Why does every good thing have to end?
I've burned every bridge before it began
(and, now, I'm sinking)
I changed, a man I thought I'd never be
I've burned every bridge before it began
I swear, I'm gonna change
Here, I wait swimming in a sea of dark
I'm lost in the current of my faults
Here, I sink holding on with all I had
The tide will rise I'm gonna own what's mine
I never meant to let you down again
I had it all but watched it drown
Why does every good thing have to end?
I've burned every bridge before it began
(and, now, I'm sinking)
I changed, a man I thought I'd never be
I've burned every bridge before it began
I swear, I'm gonna change
All I wanna do is break free
All I wanna do is break free
I never meant to let you down again
I had it all but watched it drown
Why does every good thing have to end?
I've burned every bridge before it
Began (and, now, I'm sinking)
I changed, a man I thought I'd never be
I've burned every bridge before it began
I swear, I'm gonna change
I swear I'm gonna change
(All I want to do is break free)
(All I want to do is break free)
I swear I'm going to change"
Metal,"Wrong, all that we are
Living, breathing lies
Wrong, all that I feel
All compassion dies

[Chorus:]
Once hand in hand
And now detached
Befriend the pace
The lonely trance, detached

Wrong, all that I see
Something inside denies
Wrong, all that I feel
Something inside me cries

[Chorus]

What can I say when there are no words?
I can't explain what I cannot understand

Wrong, all that we do
Dismiss the things we've said
Wrong, all we become
We stumble misguided

[Chorus]

Something in you, something in me
We're trying to control
Something in you, something in me
We're trying to overcome
Something in you, something in me
We're trying to understand
Something in you, something in me
We're trying to break out

What can I say when there are no words ?
I can't explain what I can't understand

Wrong
Wrong
Wrong

Metal,"[Music: O. Alexander] [Lyrics: O. Alexander] Forever the snow falls into a pond of tears As they fall from the sky. . . descending, sometimes they cry Sometimes they cry, autumn trees they weep In sadness suffering, for soon shall I die Forward to a path of lonliness I walk upon As the sun fades into the distance Darkness begins to enshroud above I am at peace so alone Harmonious nightfall has arrived Place of sadness I journey through A place where no life dwells In this realm of Isolation Darkness is closing in on me I am at peace so alone Beyond all pain and suffering A sea of tormented souls wash away my tears In sufferance I am not healed For I am in torment As the wind blows in silence Darkness be taken to peace Vultures are singing such sweet songs Am I to die in this place. . . I look into the cold water The reflection of my face appears No longer can I cry, I drink in serenity From the lake of sadness Winter the frost of december Mist surrounds the pale moon At last I rest this endless rest I am not dead yet I have not life Sometimes they cry, autumn trees they weep In sadness suffering, for soon shall I die Forward to a path of lonliness I walk upon As the sun fades into the distance Darkness has surrounded me At peace, so alone. . . Forever the snow falls into a pond of tears As they fall from the sky. . . descending, sometimes they cry"
Metal,"Sorry it has been so long since you received my last transmission,
meanwhile I've studied them - learned about their strange condition.
Now I think I understand why they live in such confusion,
sadly they'll never change - I have come to this conclusion....

Planet Earth is great to visit - It's great to visit
(but you wouldn't want to live there.)

I am the mariner who navigates seas celestial,
astronaut ambassador sent to foreign shores terrestrial.
Now with hindsight I admit I don't admire the humans' lot,
frail bodies - fragile, ill equipped, their lives are hard (but they are not).

Planet Earth is great to visit - It's great to visit
(but you wouldn't want to live there.)

And when you know the ways of men
then you can only pity them,
every day a raging storm -
castaway in a carbon based life form.

I've wandered far (I've wondered hard) and have one source of comfort only -
when I share my thoughts with you mortality is not so lonely.
Countless starts between us - myriad the things I miss,
I say farewell and think of home, the static drowns my parting kiss.

Planet Earth is great to visit - It's great to visit
(but you wouldn't want to live there.)

And as your signal slowly wanes -
the fears return (my growing pains),
here it is for what it's worth -
yet another postcard from planet Earth.

Now with hindsight I admit I don't admire the humans' lot,
frial bodies - ill equipped, their lives are hard (but they are not).

Planet Earth is great to visit - It's great to visit
(but you wouldn't want to live there.)

And when you know the ways of men
then you can only pity them,
every day a raging storm -
castaway in a carbon based life form.

Planet Earth is great to visit - It's great to visit
(but you wouldn't want to live there.)"
Metal,"I used to be blind Living inside a dream someone had created Without knowing where I really was Searching my mind for the answer My hands was still shaking The lightning I had called A burning feeling but still I felt it was right That strike destroyed my enemy Burned his face into ashes I was never again the same Once again I'm here My eyes are shining Deep in the dark shadows I'm hunting desperately for a victim Blood will soon be shed, but I bet you already knew I don't want to do this, but that's a killers nature Had never believed that I existed As a statue I had guarded his cave Then one day there came a man His hands made the stone turn to flesh I could see again and hate pounded through my veins I had returned again to be the killer Called back from my sleep Once again I'm here My eyes are shining Deep in the dark shadows I'm hunting desperately for a victim Blood will soon be shed, and I bet you already knew But that's a killers nature"
Metal,"Breathe!
Suffocation within
because of what your sayin'
To understand!
Is to begin again
Yet to Begin!
Is to live again
I tried living my life through your eyes
Smother me with your ways, to death, no breath.
Your choking what little faith I have left.
In time I find the truth lies, Inside the truth lies, Inside
Breathe!
Suffocation within
because of what your sayin'
To understand!
Is to begin again
Yet to Begin!
Is to live again
I would die, to breathe again
I would die, to breathe again
I would die, to breathe again
I would die, to breathe again

I would die, to breathe again
I would die, to breathe again

She walks down to the store today
The devil walks with her and he thinks she's great
When she looks at me I don't know what I saw
I think He's trying to make me his son-in-law
Well she walked by, walk by, walk by, walked on by
Walk by, walk by, walk by, walked on by
Let's Go
Egos fly when she walks by
She caught my eye one october ninth
22 days before Halloween
How did I know she'd be my evil queen
Well she walked by, walk by, walk by, walked on by
Walk by, walk by, walk by, walked on by
My mother warned me against girls like you
She said stay away from them son you know they're not true
All they're gonna do is put you under a spell
and when ur fallin down
you're going straight to hell
Walk by, walk by, walk by, walked on by
Walk by, walk by, walk by, I'm gonna walk on by
Let's Go
Walk on by (x 4)."
Metal,"I thought that I was dead
I thought my life was over
You could've snapped my neck
It wouldn't even make a difference
I was a bloody mess
I couldn't get enough of this
I've been broken, I've been beaten down
That was the last time my heart will ever hit the ground
I can take it, I can face it now
That was the last time my heart will ever hit the ground
I was a worthless king
My life just didn't matter
You were a morbid queen
Dancing with this cold cadaver
Hell put me to the test
I couldn't get enough of it
I've been broken, I've been beaten down
That was the last time my heart will ever hit the ground
I can take it, I can face it now
That was the last time my heart will ever hit the ground
I was the innocent
The murder on myself
You weren't the only one
Falling from the cross-hairs that you held
I smelled betrayal on your hands
You cut me open where I stand
I was the innocent
I was the innocent
I've been broken, I've been beaten down
That was the last time my heart will ever hit the ground
I can take it, I can face it now
That was the last time my heart will ever hit the ground
I've been broken, I've been beaten down
That was the last time my heart will ever hit the ground

Metal,"Wherever I go, wherever I go
I have to question the hand that I hold close
Wherever I go, wherever I go
I have to silence the words that you fear most

Don't ever let go, don't ever let go
Are we destined to hit the ground below?
Don't ever let go, don't ever let go
We're at the end of a burning tightrope

Now I'm waiting on the corner in the back of your mind
It's a lonely place to live, and I got nowhere to hide
'Cause you told me that you'd never be afraid of heights again
Nobody ever thought that we could make it this high
You're the only one I'd follow 'til the end of time
If we fall, we fall together baby, don't think twice again

Together I know, together I know
That we'd burn like a rocket's afterglow
Together I know, together I know
We could conquer the stars beyond this world

We let it all go, we let it all go
I'm just a voice on a broken radio
We let it all go, we let it all go
We got lost in the constellations

Now I'm waiting on the corner in the back of your mind
It's a lonely place to live, and I got nowhere to hide
'Cause you told me that you'd never be afraid of heights again
Nobody ever thought that we could make it this high
You're the only one I'd follow 'til the end of time
If we fall, we fall together baby, don't think twice again

And after all these years, and all of this time
Darling, if I'm still a question in your mind
Just say the words and this will end

You told me that you'd never be afraid of heights 
You told me that you'd never be afraid of heights 
You told me we should never be afraid of heights again
You told me that you'd never be afraid of heights 
You told me that you'd never be afraid of heights 
If we fall, we fall together baby, don't think twice again

Wherever I go, wherever I go
I hear your voice on a broken radio
Wherever I go, wherever I go
I know we'll burn like a rocket's afterglow
Don't ever let go, don't ever let go
So are we destined to hit the ground below?
Don't ever let go, don't ever let go
Are we just watching the final chapter close?"
Metal,Embodied into this world Satan's curse upon your head The age of discernment seals Your fates final end Living in the unconscious realm Not hearing CHRIST knock Too dead to reality Talking but not walking the walk Comatose your infested body lies awake Comatose souls deprived of spiritual food Comatose this unconscious decision slowly Contaminates you Minds and souls set apart Wickedness searing from the start Identities drawn but you never look beyond Your filthy blackened heart
Metal,"The boy's got a head like an atom bomb
Hang him from a cross like the number one son
And he's been waiting so long
to get it on.
The boy's 15 but he's 16 gauge
Wants to get out of his Jesus cage
He's already torn out the last page
It's the ""latest rage""
Violence for the people
They always eat the hand that bleeds
Violence for the people
Give the kids what they need
Kill your god, Kill your god
Kill your TV
The boy's purified by the quitter gods
Burning up his cross like a revelation
And his glass jaw opens
Like a puppet head
Violence for the people
They always eat the hand that bleeds
Violence for the people
Give the kids what they need
Kill your god, Kill your god
Kill your TV
This is what you should fear
You are what you should fear
Violence for the people
They always eat the hand that bleeds
Violence for the people
Give the kids what they need
Kill your god, Kill your TV"

Waiting for life to ignite

A leap of faith, I'll
Jump into the fire, no fear, I'll
Take you the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in!
The ring of the bells, feeling you resonate
Into the night, hearing you fade away
Do or die, this is a choice that I'm making
And it feels like I'm living a lie
This is the moment for taking
A leap of faith, I'll
Jump into the fire, no fear, I'll
Take you the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in!
Nothing's gonna kill me, come take me
Closer to the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in!

That's screaming out
So fill your lungs, inhale the future
That's screaming out

Metal,"Words of cunning
Shining stunning.
Men of grandeur
Blinding, numbing

With winsome wiles in specious styles.
Speeches etching,
Rhyming, wrenching.
Men so shallow

Stumble fetching
For words that maze, to clear their daze.
Calm in disarray
Sinking day by day

Hopeless never see
Save what they believe.
Choices weakening,
Ever sinking.

Men are poisoned into thinking
That they've a voice above their noise.
Spheres of disarray
Worsened by the day

Sadly led and fooled
Without thoughts to rule."

Are you' Are you a Man or a mouse? -Hey!
Metal,"You there
Bringer of my despair
You are stagnation of hope and will
O you personify loss and remorse
And you hide until my fears reappear

[Chorus]
The love for life once bright
(Out of sight)
A burning fuse
The only flame I have
Fate's spiral down this curve
(Shall only serve)
The seeds growing my misery
These wounds kill time
My struggle sublime
Idle the blood
A black state of mind
All dreams left behind

You claim to be my long absent friend
You are the cancer that just moved in
You come with the dark night of the soul
But I am turning my back on you
You know I do

[Repeat x2]
Idle the blood
A black state of mind
All my dreams left behind"

Aren't you tired of being weak?
Such rage that you could scream. the stars right out of the sky

I am exhumed just a little less human

Deep despair and doubt

I hear the strangest sounds, can anyone hear them?

I hear them

Protect me from myself, off to the quiet room
Weird specters ride the air, I know I can't be wrong
I see and hear them too, can anyone else hear them?"

In the dust of past mistakes
Leaving for the darkness
Of tears and cold heartaches

The wasted years of dark insanity

As the memories eat me alive

No more a human being
Just a fool of anxiety
Unable to escape
The darkest insanity"

Waiting for his time to come when he could make his name
Riding into town with a look upon his brow like he's gonna take from you
Or gonna take you out.

Phoenix was an Indian who had a knack for robbing banks
In the mesas of New Mexico is where they made their plans
To rob the Denver bank and to leave no one alive
And with their plans they rode northeast, their fingers on their guns
Looking for an angel or the pale rider to come
Looking for an angel or the pale rider to come

There back in Santa Fe, where you will find my love
A Spanish maid named Isabelle, with skin like holy dove
And if this plan goes bad, and I should meet my end
You send her Texas and make sure to treat her well

Connor was a law man - he protected the Denver Bank
He vowed to catch the riders, he vowed to see them hanged.
He told his men ""Be ready and when you see the rider's come,
Put a bullet between their eyes"" and the pale rider he comes
A bullet between the eyes and the pale rider he comes.

On the Denver horizon, that's where it all went down
Getting into to focus as the riders dust settled down
Connor had the street staked out and ready for the draw
And the tension mounted in the heat of it all
Connor said ""Don't worry, I'm scared to death myself
When I look into his eyes I see a demon straight from hell!
Coming straight for me - coming for the kill""
That's when the shots were fired
BANG
And it was done

All were looking for an angel when the pale rider, he comes
Looking for an angel an the pale rider he comes . . .

OH - MY - GOD
It's judgement day and I'm not prepared
Everybody's out there's running scared
So - take a little bit off the top
I don't care, just make it stop
I won't give another soul.
to you
I won't give another life.
to you
You don't have to stop!
STOP!
STOP!
STOP!
Do one thing and say something cryptic
But the styles always clash
One thing I know for sure
Hypothetical won't work anymore
One wrong move and they will pound!
My nails are tight inside my wrists
This sacrament is sacrilege and sentimental
Deity experimental - Faith is accidental
I won't give another soul.
to you
I won't give another life.
to you
I won't give another thought.
to you
I won't give any more of my hope.
to you
Hypothetical won't work anymore
One move open they will pay
My nails, are driving inside my wrists
This sacrament, is sacrilege, and sentimental
Maybe it's experimental
Circumsize the dental
I won't give another soul (to you)
I won't give another life (to you)
I won't give another thought (to you)
I won't give anyone my hope (to you)"
Metal,"That was all I got and now you got me
All I ever really wanted was to take the blame
I will go down in history and not down in flames
Meningitis - I will survive this
Dry sockets and a schizophrenic crisis
The Time of The Nine has begun
Get out of the way or you will suffer as one
Oh, this is so typical - apocalyptical
Hanging on abysmal release - Jesus
I don't need this - don't wanna be this
Icon in the making - My hands are fucking shaking
What if God doesn't care?
What if God doesn't care
Remember - Surrender - The time is now
Continue - We're in you...
And we will burn your cities down
America is a killing name
It doesn't feel or discriminate
Life is just a killing field
It's all that's left - nothing's real
Throw away your disposable past
And fall apart like a cigarette ash
We are the fatal and vital ones of the world
And we will burn your cities down
What if God doesn't care?

We are the fatal and vital ones of the world
And we will burn your cities down
Down
We will burn your cities down
Feed the hungry - feed them shit
Feed them bones and politics
You wanna revolutionize?
Be specific and believe your eyes
Start a war in another backyard
And we'll destroy your house of cards
Give me a minute and I'll change your mind
Give me a bullet and I'll change your life
Remember - Surrender - The time is now
Continue - We're in you...
And we will burn your cities down
America is a killing name
It doesn't feel or discriminate
Life is just a killing field
It's all that's left - nothing's real
Throw away your disposable past

What a phase to run
We don't judge no priest, we don't preach we cum
Smoke all of my lungs, fuck you i'm having fun
We ain't blind, we see
We don't beat we drum
Organize the ways, damn this life is a stage
Grab the moment and own it,
i'm looking forward today, before i hop on this plane
It's important to say goodbye to my kids,
you know you better behave
I'm living outta my soul, fuck it there's no regrets
I'm hittin' texas we're selling this cash money a bet
I've seen this ship before and i ain't have no fear
I'm near, i'm near, i'm near
Bitch i'm right here
Fuck it ima drink if i don't get dui
See these tickets sneak up, on you like a sniper eye, yeah,
I'm right above the clouds boy

I had been through this storm, been through the rain
People tellin' me lies, nobody taking the blame
Jumping through all my thoughts like it's a picket fence
All the shit that i've done doesn't really makes sence
Show 'em how to behave, show 'em how to go far
Show 'em how to believe, show 'em just who you are
Fell in love with a stripper, she happy outta my head
Every fucked up lady you can say what she said
With every single right, i'm always born white
I'm punching these walls and it ain't no right
No cheese, no bite, come alive in the night
And i sleep in the day that's some vampire life
Cash money metal, i should get a medal
Going for the gold, life don't settle
It's a waste to the pain, beauty is the name
Taggin' on my heart cause my life won't change
Pain ain't so beautiful, the city of angels

Metal,"Trying to tear me apart!
Breaking me down to the bone!
So listen closely cause what you don't see
Is there's still blood inside this bleeding heart
Still beating
Still breathing
Falling from grace, you laugh in my face!
But you are the one who will leave with the beating!
With bleedin' hands I fight for a life that?s beat me down
Stand up and scream while the rest of the world won?t make a sound!
Rising again from the fire
A phoenix alive and inspired
You can't erase me, won't even phase me
No one hears a fucking word you say
Still bleeding
Still breathing
Falling from grace you laugh in my face
But you are the one who will leave with a beating
With bleedin' hands I fight for a life that?s beat me down
Stand up and scream while the rest of the world won?t make a sound!
With bleedin' hands I fight with the pride left in me now
Stand up and scream while the rest of the world won?t make a sound!
Stand and scream
Stand and scream
Stand and scream
Stand and scream
With bleedin' hands I fight for a life that?s beat me down
Stand up and scream while the rest of the world won?t make a sound!
With bleedin' hands I fight with the pride left in me now
Stand up and scream or the rest of the world won?t make a sound!

Stand up and scream while the rest of the world won?t make a sound"
Metal,"Can we say that we are free
Our hands are bound and voices silent
I'm sure it's not a dream
I am awake, my eyes are open

I can't accept and won't concede
In aftermath we find redemption
The causes that are seized
And disguised as revolution

Quell the rage that deeply seethes
The extremes of these devotions
Dismantle the machine
The device of their creation

I can't accept and won't concede
That this is who we are
The conflict that is seized
And disguised as greater notions

To the songs that sing of glory and the brave
Are we dreaming there are better days to come
When will the banners and the victory parades
Celebrate the day a better world was won

On the day, the storm has just begun
I will still hope there are
Better days to come

In the face of what I say
My words will turn to anger
Malevolence in need
Cannot provide direction

I won't accept this thought
That this is who we are
Positions never change
Losing all forward motion

All of that which deeply seethes
Temper your devotion
Dismantle the machine
The device of your convictions

I can't accept and won't concede
That this is who we are
The conflict that is seized
And disguised as greater notions

To the songs that sing of glory and the brave
Are we dreaming there are better days to come
When will the banners and the victory parades
Celebrate the day a better world was won

To the songs that sing of glory and the brave
Are we dreaming there are better days to come
When will the banners and the victory parades
Celebrate the day a better world was won

On the day the storm has just begun
I will still hope there are
Better days to come

On the day the storm has just begun
I will still hope there are
Better days to come

Metal,"A lethal bolt pierces the air
Like a falling star
Young eyes are observing in the darkness
His stare's reflecting fright
And scared he's struggling hard
To go back
Uneasy warders guard
The jail on quiet nights
Young eyes contemplating somewhere to hide
Mankind will soon learn
That the end has come in time
Dividing lands, retracing
All the borders will colide
Revealing ages when the absence
Of forgiveness rules our lives
Home how I go
My badge is wearing out
Written on the sand
Words to reconcile - unholy wars
Forgive us our father
For we have sinned
Blinded by pride
We know not what we do
Thy kingdom will be done
By holy wars
The battle is over
But the war still rages on!
Dividing lands, retracing
All the borders will colide
Revealing ages when the absence
Of forgiveness rules our lives
Home how I go
My badge is wearing out
Written on the sand
Words to reconcile - unholy wars"
Metal,"We walk through the ages 
The world on our shoulders 
The burden we carry 
To the dark end of our days 

A thousand eyes watching 
Every step we are taking 
Waiting to see us 
Struggle and fall 

And when we are beaten 
The cross holds us down 
I hear them laughing 
And walking away 

Carry the Cross 
And suffer the loss 
Hear my confession 
Forever damnation 

Reincarnation 
Bleeding forever 
Recover the pain 
Pain gives me strength 

Pick up the cross 
And carry it on 
Over and over 
The wheel turns again 

And when we are beaten 
The cross holds us down 
Ihear them laughing 
And walking Away 

Carry the cross 
And suffer the loss 
Hermy confession 
Forever damnation"
Metal,"Sourceless, rythmless, heartless.
I scan the desert.
Since I, in my beasthood saw the dancers there.
As my hands, two tiny figures, came visible,
Like a carniver of flesh.
A union of monstrosities.

Curveless, boundless, eyeless.
I flee from the source of my agony.
Since I, in my beasthood, took form
In new, alien anatomies.
My limbs towering, mounting in celebration.
Murmuring the approval of new glories;
New threats, new intimacy.

With this, I am fit to charm the Devil.
Sneering down my pale face.
I am erect with his anger and lust.
I am the grace of them all.

Still sneering, drooling, floating.
Breeding curves of hell.
And shreds of pre-human gloss.
This softens those songs to dust."
Metal,"i hear the roar of a big machine
two worlds and in between
hot metal and methedrine
i hear empire down
i hear empire down
i hear the roar of a big machine
two worlds and in between
love lost
fire at will
dum-dum bullets and shoot to kill
i hear
dive
bombers
and
empire down
empire down
i hear the sons of the city and dispossessed
get down
get undressed
get pretty but you and me
we got the kingdom
we got the key
we got the empire
now as then
we don't doubt
we don't take direction
lucretia
my reflection
dance the ghost with me
we look hard
we look through
we look hard to see for real
such things i hear
they don't make sense
i don't see much evidence
i don't feel
i don't feel
i don't feel
a long train held up by page on page
a hard reign held up by rage
once a railroad
now it's done. i hear the roar of a big machine
two worlds and in between
hot metal and methedrine
i hear empire down. we got the empire
now as then
we don't doubt
we don't take reflection
lucretia
my direction
dance the ghost with me."

Metal,"Step back cause the bass is fuzzin'
Bloodhound Gang bangs more than the dirty dozen
Alley oop here comes the slam i know where I stand
I'm feelin' like Anthrax cause you know O'm the man
Yea I dug your dame but all I did was kiss her
But I got to second base with your mom and your sister
I'll wipe the grin off your face like I was a can of Windex
I threw a right I threw a right was I live or Memorex
Go down down deep deep in and out quick
Cause I'm harder than Chinese arithmetic
Now my fist is in your face cause you stood in my way
You tried to talk your shit and your ass got paid
I get stupid like the mongoloid Corky
Welcome to McDonald's may I take your order
Cause I'm cold kicken lyrics like my arm was on fire
Like Pinnochio my nose don't grow cause I ain't no liar

Go down go down to get it up get it up
Go down go down to get it up y'all

Clap it on clap it off sniff my exhaust
Cause i got more steps than Barishnikov
Like a pirouette, a pirouette, a pair of wet jeans
You don't understand but your girl knows what I mean
So I kicks my lines kind of complex
A text of intricate words and other spoken effects
Like a preacher on the mount teaching things he doesn't follow
When you tried to hit the brake but pushed on the throttle
Mr. Goody Two Shoes picture the scenario
Your girl blew me as I blew your stereo
And I gots more bass than a baseball diamond
Don't put me on your chalkboard cause I'm not down with Simon
Sonic boom in your room assume you're not there
Booty licken' nugget picken' with your dad downstairs
Love is just a fallacy I got more force than gravity
I can run all night like an Energizer battery

Go down go down to get it up get it up
Go down go down to get it up y'all"

I have to give in.

It's the fear
Fear of the dark
It's growing inside of me,
that one day will come to life.
Have to save
To say my beloved,
there is no escape,
because my faith is horror and doom.
Hold down your head now,
just let me pass by.
Don't feed my fear,
if you don't want it out.
I fear who I am becoming,
I feel that I am losing all beauty within.
I can no longer restrain it,
my strength it is fading.
I have to give in.

And ever since that day,
infected with its rage

worked your hands to bleed
don't give up my friendwell in this game called life you got to keep on trying
don't make no body push you down and give you pure problem
oi! life it is for living not for aggravation
when their getting under your skin and trying to cause you tension
you tell them
inside this flesh nuff ah we jusa suffer
and influences they will come take we over
1 think in life i and i must remember
stand up for something and you'll hear the oppressor singing
you got to make up your mind

where do we go there are so many signs
life
choices and decisions
you got to make up your mind

choices and decisions
well well at first you don't smoke weed but now you're hooked on smack
you look back over your life and you wish you could go back
rewind reject it and start it again
you know you wouldn't end up with this juxtaposition
right! inside this flesh nuff ah we jusa suffer
and influences they will come take we over
1 think in life i and i must remember
stand up for something and you'll hear the oppressor singing
to follow or to lead
or do you just pretend?
to pause or to proceed
the choice is yours my friend
which way do you go? where you gunner go? i do not know! you see
life is one big road with lots of signs
surely you'll find
you got to make up your mind to face rality all the time
many ah problem many ah joy
never you try to take life for a toy
some doing good lord some doing bad
all of these choices are driving me

I'm searchin' for something
That gets me out of this place

Like a war needs treason

Hey, I'm gonna ride insane
And at the moment life starts to burn
I'm gonna ride this sunset to the grave

Ticking faster, I can see the end
I'm reaching out, to pull myself
Up to see again
I need this
Like an angel that's bleeding

I hear the Devil screaming
We go through hell for a reason

Hey, I'm gonna ride insane

For longer days and nights this strange redemption'
With words you've bled me dry
Now dust falls from these wounds

Into the airless night I'm cast
Hear me call you
I know I can't create a lie you won't see through
Through in this blessed tone I am a child in wanting
A feeling not unlike regret permeates me
And with the birth of fear I am set free

From these wounds I claim redemption
From these wounds I am redeemed

In passing I recall with such vivid clarity
The soft whispering reminders of foolish notions
Too late I realized my wrongs and my carelessness
Now from the stone I hear you call
I can not answer

Believe me my regret runs deep yet I know peace
For in 24 years I've always been inspired
The loss I do regret and still I know redemption
For you are better gone now you are set free"
Metal,"Catch me as I fall
Say you're here and it's all over now
Speaking to the atmosphere
No one's here and I fall into myself
This truth drives me into madness
I know I can stop the pain if I will it all away
If I will it all away
Don't turn away
[Don't give in to the pain]
Don't try to hide
[Though they're screaming your name]
Don't close your eyes
[God knows what lies behind them]
Don't turn out the light
[Never sleep, never die]
I'm frightened by what I see
But somehow I know that there's much more to come
Immobilized by my fear
And soon to be blinded by tears
I can stop the pain if I will it all away
If I will it all away
Don't turn away
[Don't give in to the pain]
Don't try to hide
[Though they're screaming your name]
Don't close your eyes
[God knows what lies behind them]
Don't turn out the light
[Never sleep, never die]
Fallen angels at my feet
Whispered voices at my ear
Death before my eyes
Lying next to me I fear
She beckons me shall I give in
Upon my end shall I begin
Forsaking all I've fallen for I rise to meet the end
Don't turn away
[Don't give in to the pain]
Don't try to hide
[Though they're screaming your name]
Don't close your eyes
[God knows what lies behind them]
Don't turn out the light
[Never sleep never die]"
Metal,"[Chorus]
Die
Your fate is sealed by lethal injection
Tried by a jury of false perception
Lied to, they bribe you
Submit to the wrong correction
Your final dose is a lethal injection

Your time has come
It's time to die
Your soul is heavy
Your heart is dry
Inner fear takes control
Say goodbye to this world

[Chorus]

Judgment falls
From the sky
Lethal injection
You die tonight
The bleeding starts
Your life passes by
Darkness falls
The end of life

Where do you stand in this Battle Cry? Tribal Soldier!
Represent I and I a, Jah Jah warrior

The reconstruction commences; the soldiers equip for the lessons
My life, a sacrifice is made new through these confessions
Manifested, this joy is my desire
Light this fire to flames; praise the name, Jehovah Jireh
Is my provider, the truth that lives inside of this fighter?
Take me higher, Master, Sire makes me a good rider
I'm gonna ride on down til I break through the front lines
And ain't going home until I gets mines
[chorus]
I grab ahold of my second chance, this time gonna make it last
Left the world came back an Outkast
To lay among the remains, through the trials and the pains
Run for cover, make shelter, uncharted terrains
Bloodstains light the paths to the ways of living breath
My soul is put to the test
Blessed with a mic in my hand, Jah make straight my steps
Then I hooked up with Payable On Death
We flow in Unity, stand in One while the foolish be
Lost in this hour, with Power we have Authority
To overcome while these cowards just pick up and run
We ain't done till this battle has been fought and won
The victory, how sweet it be, is already ours
Holding the stars, is the man that carries my scars
Always the same, I wear his name with now shame
Here in this Battle Cry, we will never die
We will never die Tribal Warriors

Calling me public enemy, but dont believe the hype.
Tough guy like the one in ""star 80"" wanna bait me. 
Hook line sinker now your lady wanna date me.
Gave your girl a little wink, so you make a big stink. 
Shoulders got a chip, so you flip like a tiddlywink. 
Know what i think? I think you might be darwins' missing link.
Get all bent out of shape when the heat is on just like a shrinky dink.
Bet i can take a hint, better than i can take a hit. 
Completely incompatible though im a pussy you're a dick. 
How can you hold a grudge when you cant even hold a job. 
Should've known butter but your not corn on the cob.
I choose to use a song for a weapon, not a sword, struck a chord. 
If i wanted to see stars i'll watch the ""academy awards"". 
That's why i ran like flock of seagulls why make-up like mary kay.
You must've given up on hair plugs, 'cause now you're going toupee.

All in all you're just another dick with no balls. 
All in all you're just another dick with no balls.

Mama said talk this out and resolve. 
Don't wanna be involved so gimme a call when you evolve.
Doggy paddle to the shallow end of the gene pool.
Half with it. Half wit. Half finished high school.
Give you a piece of my mind but i know you want it splattered. 
Heard you like your woman like you like your shrimp, you like em' battered. 
Wife beater perfectly fitting apparel. 
Where's your brother Daryl? Where's your other brother Daryl?
Givin' me that macho man randy savage stare.
Wanna snap into a slim jim, break limbs but do i care?
No sorry, im a lover, not a fighter. Commit your crime. 
I'll be glad to do your girlfriend, i'll be glad that you do time.
Here's the deal i cop a feel you cop a plea, but get the maximum.
Now we both got records but the difference is mine's platinum.
Definitely showed this yellow bellied wimp limp in your cell. Now though alone. 
When you're choking your chicken your chick will be choking on this chickens bone.

Metal,"So cold is the night
It's silent without light
Since days they promised us
To be home again

The death comes closer
He fear's coming nearer to us
There will be no tomorrow,
Do we go insane

I have a picture of you with me

Will there ever be an end
Will there ever be a last goodbye
Please tell me there is hope
In silence till we die

There is still longing
In my eyes I see a different earth
I'm not impressed, it's just the silence

There must be something to believe in

Will there ever be an end
Will there ever be a last goodbye
Please tell me there is hope
In silence till we die

Waiting it's lately
And there will be a fight
Escape to a new world
What will be behind these lies

Will there ever be an end
Will there ever be a last goodbye
Please tell me there is hope
In silence till we die"
Metal,"hey
are you still awake?
i just woke up in vancouver
but i haven't slept in days
hey
are you still awake?
it's 3am
and i can't seem to shake the smile from my face
i know that i've been missing home
but i don't remember where that was
and one thing that i promise you
is that i'll be home soon
these traveller nights don't feel so alone
when i'm waking up to the sound of the phone
we're minutes away yet miles apart
this is the sound of the separated heart
hey there
are you still awake
i'm still miles from ohio
and it seems like years away
the years have slowly ticked on by
with another overtired drive
but i'm still sitting here thinking of being by your side
these traveller nights don't feel so alone
when i'm waking up to the sound of the phone
we're minutes away yet miles apart
this is the sound of the separated heart
as all this time slips away
with all i've done on the road while you wait
i'm stuck feeling like i've got no place to go
i know the time zones will change
with all i've done on the road while you wait
i'm stuck feeling like i've got no place to go
these traveller nights don't feel so alone
when i'm waking up to the sound of the phone
we're minutes away yet miles apart
this is the sound of the separated
this is the sound of the separated
this is the sound of the separated
this is the sound of the separated
this is the sound of the separated heart"
Metal,"Shut up, don't pass the blame
The same god-damn thing just the name's have changed
On the day you were busted your forgot the line
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
An animal's acting instinctively
Glorified murderer, insanity
Do you think I'd kill you just count to one
You're the coward, with the gun

Yeah, you thought you knew me
Yeah, you hardly knew me
You don't know me
I know I shouldn't care
My crazy senses of right and wrong that can't be made to break this,
break this, break this

I see something wrong and fix it with my hands
I walk a thin blue line, this cross I came to bear

So now you're dead well wha' dya know
And am I sorry no, I don't think so
They wanted sympathy now that's a bit much
How much did you show, how much
Take the value for one human life
And place it all right down on a roll of the dice
And a one, two, three for the pain you bring
I'm the bird without the left wing

Yeah, you thought you knew me
Yeah, you hardly knew me
You don't know me
I know I shouldn't care
My crazy sense of right and wrong that can't be made to break this,
break this, break this

I see something wrong and fix it with my hands
I walk a thing blue line, this cross I came to bear

Random acts of senseless, random acts of senseless
Random acts of senseless, random acts of senseless
Violence

I see something wrong and I fix it with my hands
I walk a thin blue line, this cross I came to bear
I see something wrong and I fix it with my hands
I walk a thin blue line and I'll be the one who laughs when,
You die"
Metal,"[Chorus]
I take drugs
I take drugs
I take drugs and you should too
[repeat]

Every day in every way
I'm looking for a fix to make me feel okay
I need something to give me hope
Like an automatic weapon or an eight ball of coke

[Chorus]

I'm stressin' out I need it now
I need some fucking pills to bring me down
What's the crime if I snort a line
Toke, choke shoot it up all at the same time

[Chorus]

I need the drugs and they need me
Drug use is the only use for me
Just say no but I'm always sayin' yes
To the D are you G S

[Chorus]"
Metal,It's not over yet - Consuming flames of the faceless one There's no time to repent - As you bow before the serpent god There is no turning back - Festering demons to hatred sworn And ready to attack - The jaws of death are hungry like a war Songs of death shall kill the lies forever and ever Baptized burning - Cold flames will purify my soul Our hearts are rotten to the core Behead the prophets - Their skulls - Trophies in the final war The plague of man - Crowned in terror - Hate and soulless might It's not over yet - Racing down these dead-end streets There's no time to repent - Festering demons to hatred sworn What we have sown - Is ours to reap Songs of death shall kill the lies forever and ever Baptized burning - Cold flames will purify my soul Our hearts are rotten to the core Behead the prophets - Their skulls - Trophies in the final war The plague of man - Crowned in terror - Hate and soulless might As we watch the angels die In the lake of sulphur - We'll watch 'em drown A massacre divine Blasphemous locust in genocide reborn The beating of your heart Echoing in silence - The sound of death As your soul is torn apart A violent cry of pain - Riding your final breath It's not over yet - Consuming flames of the faceless one There's no time to repent - As you bow before the serpent god There is no turning back - Festering demons to hatred sworn And ready to attack - The jaws of death are hungry like a war Songs of death shall kill the lies forever and ever Baptized burning - Cold flames will purify my soul Our hearts are rotten to the core Behead the prophets - Their skulls - Trophies in the final war The plague of man - Crowned in terror - Hate and soulless might
Metal,"You go on living day by day with blood on your hands
Those lies they hypnotize
But you ruined them anyway
And soon you'll come to find you can't turn water into wine
And then we all will see you and all your misery

You better save yourself boy
Before it gets to late
Cause all your pain and suffering will not wait
But what I got you could never take away
Welcome to hell
This is your judgment day

Don't ask for forgiveness
Watch for your soul
You know the answer for
Why your so cold
Don't try to run away
You are here and you must stay
You learn to cry these tears
For one hundred thousand years

You better save yourself boy
Before it gets to late
Cause all your pain and suffering will not wait
But what I got you could never take away
Welcome to hell
This is your judgment day

You better save yourself boy
Before it gets to late

Metal,"For blood! For blood! For blood! The legions file in And the crowd, the crowd it roars As the lion, the lion stalks And Christians are thrown into the pit And the frenzied minions chant for it For blood! For blood! For blood! We must have blood They're dragged in chains From dungeons Screaming for mercy Pleading to be freed Disciplined with whips Aggression They're dragged to the pit Still begging to be spared And the crowd, the crowd it roars As the lion, the lion strikes Ripping Christians limb from limb And the crowds are screaming With murderous intent For blood! For blood For blood! We must have blood They're dragged by their hair Screaming in despair The crowds are chanting loud To the lions with this filth They watch, as they are mauled Believers strewn from side to side A feast of death, of blood and gore They're praying to the gods Let there be more"
Metal,"as i listen to my brother speak
of the hell inside his head
i wonder if it's in me too
it's in me too
and too often i'm thinking the same thing
my indecision is my own
but he proved me wrong
these words run deeper
the imperfections and differences
of our skin
only mean one thing
the hell in me is the same hell in him
the dead are alive
and i can't help but sit back and wonder if something is wasted
something is wasted
because you and i are fighting the fight
we are divided
we woke from a dream where we once were united
we are divided
and we're kept awake hoping you can unite us
i'll walk through hell and back
cold blood streaming through my eyes
i'm sick of walking in circles
i'm killing myself just to prove to you i am alive
the dead are alive
and i can't help but sit back and wonder if something is wasted
something is wasted
'cause you and i
are fighting the same fight and it's time you know
that i won't leave you here to fight alone
the dead are alive
and i can't help but sit back and wonder if something is wasted
something is wasted
'cause you and i
are fighting the same fight and it's time you know
the dead are alive
and i can't help but sit back and wonder if something is wasted
something is wasted
'cause you and i
are fighting the same fight and it's time you know
i won't leave you here to fight alone"
Metal,"welcome!
to my kingdom of hearts
feed my ego with lust
slide my fingers inside
by the grace of my hands
take in my wonderland
where the streets painted red
cover me with your youth and beauty
cover me with your youth
bow down

Metal,I am the one breaks all This misery you call your life I am the one who will carry you To an altar of joy Follow me Flee from this Except nothing but the best I will hide all your pain Resort to the unknown with Silence The way I will keep Silence From letting you flee You are the one who changed me To a quivering mess You are the one who stopped me From doing all I can Now's your time Let me in Let me in your functioning mind I will hide all your pain Resort to the unknown with Silence The way I will keep Silence From letting you flee I feel your stench So warm I'm home Let me stay And feel you more I come All over now Where do I go from here Leave me behind Never again bitch don't even try Silence your mouths you whore
Metal,"The siren sings a lonely song
Of all the wants and hungers
The lust of love a brute desire
The ledge of life goes under

Divide the dream into the flesh
Kaleidoscope and candle eyes
Empty winds scrape on the soul
But never stop to realize

Animal whisperings
Intoxicate the night
Hypnotize the desperate
Slow motion light

Wash away into the rain
Blood, milk and sky
Hollow moons illuminate
And beauty never dies

Running wild, running blind
In the body deep
A thousand years beside myself
I do not sleep

Seduce the world at rest
Dead water lies
Ride the only one who knows
Beauty never dies"
Metal,"The End of day, the fading light falls on the sentinel of night the guardian of her tombstone forgotten and alone She cries below the moonshine all memories of her fade in time impressions of her beauty from beyond the grave The time has passed so slowly an old man now I am lived a life so senseless waiting for the end The time has cracked your tombstone a sign of the decay on a grave so nameless the inscription washed away They said Angels never cry but I saw her cry They said Angels never die but I saw her die All life I spent praying, praying for my death waiting for my doomsday, to do my final step a journey to world, without loneliness and pain a journey to a world, to get her back again. They said Angels never cry but I saw her cry They said Angels never die but I saw her die Shadows fill my mind I take my final breath I leave the world behind into a long awaited death [2x] Deathlike silence fills the night then an angel appeared in the shining light A release for a praying man to die A release for a bitter man who cries A release for a lonely man in the end The fulfill of the love which I demand A touch of her makes me remember as if it was yesterday The strings of life are cut, my soul starts to drift away Into another world our souls will unify A lifetime of pain is forgotten A life long I wanted to die They said angels never cry but I saw her cry They said angels never die but I saw her die I thought a livetime it was a lie but it was no lie she came back to me again just as I died."
Metal,"I think I'm happy
Mostly happy
On a green autumn day
I'm walking lazy
Barely moving
Settle out and fade away
Seems a life is something more than a journey with no end
I just want to lose it all and find myself again
I'm on my own… I'm on my own…
I don't need a conscience to tell me how I feel
I don't need these weary eyes to focus on what to conceal
I don't need anybody to tell me who I am
Blame it on a broken heart- I'm falling apart again"
Metal,"Fix the mental, as if that changes anything
Your heart is cured now, you're normal once again
One confession, you thought that's all it took
But redemption, doesn't let you off the hook

One of us
Can't erase the past to change who he would be
One of us
On a whim would act, then look for sympathy
Not from me

Hear me say

One more
Chance to believe in
That you can even the score
One more
Place at the table
Always room for one more
Room for one more

Thinking evil, is that just your normal gig
Fueled by hatred, happy as a stuffed pig
You're so lonely, everyone around you reeks
Of indifference, thriving in their apathy

One of us
Can't erase the past to change who he would be
One of us
On a whim would act, then look for sympathy
Not from me

Hear me say

One more
Chance to believe in
That you can even the score
One more
Place at the table
Always room for one more
One more
Chance to believe in
That you can even the score
One more
Place at the table
Always room for one more
Room for one more

Your schism, my distress
Your failure is my success
Squeezed out, kept me down
What goes around comes around
I can wait you out
Patience is my virtue
Call it payback, call it proper grounds
What goes around always comes around, always comes around

Hear me say

One more 
Chance to believe in
That you can even the score
One more
Place at the table
Always room for one more
One more
Chance to believe in
That you can even the score
One more 
Place at the table
Always room for one more
Room for one more
Always room for one more"
Metal,"I grant to you no privilege of person
No sense of self, a denial of choice
It wants out so from all the little bits and pieces
A simple case of lost and found, a wicked new beginning
I don't ever want to see

It's the oldest trick in the book, just like everything you always knew
Turned upon its very end there's nothing left to be
Half a mind to say all the things that bother me today
You better check if it's me, in that ""coffin"" of yours or just the one you thought you knew

I am one
Who am I?
No character to be lost inside

A mind is hard to please so wander aimlessly
Hands clenched in fists of rage concealed in frustration
There's a part of me that cannot deal
With the character I am forced to be
A thinly veiled plan to lay your world afoot
Lost in community, blind in belonging

Is there really nothing more than this?
The emptiness remains
So put on your brave face and take the plunge again"
Metal,"They're walking by the night
The Moon has frozen blue
Long black coats a shelter for the rain
Their load must get through

Now bats are leaving their trees
They're joining the call
Seven Satanic Hell Preachers
Heading for the hall

Bringing a blood of a newborn child
Got to succeed, if not it's Satan's fall

Home...come home
Evil messengers with blood stained wings
Home...come home
Home...come home

Is it Satan's fall?
No it's Satan's call
Craniums high on stakes
It's Satan's epigraph
Something new can't erase...666
They call him the beast

Use your demon eyes, uncover the disguise
Time is out...
Yeah, I don't need your God
On the law of Satan
Pray and obey it forever
Oh the law of Satan"
Metal,"Now that I have nothing,
I resolve to be nothing,
For nothing to harm me,
And nothing to gain,
I resolve again, to be nothing,
For nothing but disappointments,
And nothing but apathy,
I resolve again, to be nothing,
And again and again I resolve to be nothing,
And finally,
I am absolved,
And them, I am nothing,
Dissolved."
Metal,"This is the fight for your life
You can't give in
So wake up son
You've got a war to win
Hey kid don't make a mistake
Remember that heroes aren't made
They're born that way
This town is ours so don't make a sound
And if you're lucky I may save this last round
Go make my day
I never forget a face
And I'm sure yours could haunt me on for days
We're outlaws
You can believe what they say
We'll leave your city in flames
There's a bounty on my head
But a smile on my face
Because we're outlaws
We'll take this song to our graves
This town is ours so don't make a sound
But if you're feeling lucky I'll save two last rounds
Take it all the way
This is the one risk to take
Don't be forgotten
[Chorus]
Through these eyes I see no fear
Live for dying
[Chorus]
This is the fight for your life
You can't give in so wake up son
You've got a war to win"
Metal,"It's just the way it goes, and everybody does,
And nobody said I can't, and this is how I feel
And I just wanted to, I really thought I could
Because The Reasons why, Why do we do the things we do?
Because, I try to make you see these things the way I do
It is what it is, and that's too bad for you
I don't even care, Why can I why not
And I do what I want, and this cause I said so
Because The Reasons why, Why do we do the things we do?
Because, I try to make you see these things the way I do
Because The Reasons why, Why do we do the things we do?
Because The Reasons, The Reasons, Cause The Reasons
Because The Reasons why, Why do we do the things we do?
Because, I try to make you see these things the way I do
Because The Reasons why, Why do we do the things we do?
Because The Reasons, Because The Reasons, I try to reason.."
Metal,"Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
I'm getting sick of hypocrites saying nothing
Got a feeling that I don't belong
You seem to feel like it's alright
Take your pick, dirty tricks and you love it
Takes a lot to just right the wrong
It just never felt so alive
You're all dead to me
[?] it was nice to know you all
Take a look [?]
You disappear but I survive
[?] black and white
It's [?]
It just never felt so alive
You're all dead to me
You're all dead to me
You're all dead to me"
Metal,"A universe to fill
Can't scratch the surface
Now a slow pay
Still why everyone watching
It's like I'm real tired of the clones
I'm real tired of the clones

Whatever you say

Make my life worth something more
Show me a light

Bring me a light
Make my life worth something more

Where's the space I fill
Where's the sympathy I killed
I need to find a meaning
I'm useless, I'm useless
Trapped inside my own web

Metal,"Take it from the best, everything I do pops
Fake ass bitches all around me just stop
I could call you out, but your shit already flops
I don't give a fuck, I'm already at the top

Take another minute and relive it, can't you see it
Bitch, you're better than you ever really thought
Better at the game and I was born and raised inside it
You can find me in the motherfucking pit
If you wanna bet that you're playing with a god 
And I hope you've prepared your case
I don't fuck around when it comes to the music
You can never really touch my pace

You come unto me just to question my roots
But you could never walk a day in my shoes
Been in the game for twelve years, what it do? 
Fuck this shit, you can find me in the moshpit

You come unto me just to question my roots
But you could never walk a day in my shoes
Been in the game for twelve years, what it do? 
Fuck this shit, you can find me in the moshpit

Are you ready, motherfuckers? Let's go! 

Take another minute to relive it
And admit it that your boy's going at it at a supersonic pace
I can take shotgun into a pub, light it up, take a grape
And then I throw it in your face
Pussy red motherfuckers doing what they're doing
All I do is hit them with the fucking truth
I'm a fucking stunner
I'm a grade A runner
And I pave my way in the mosh pit

You come unto me just to question my roots
But you could never walk a day in my shoes
Been in the game for twelve years, what it do? 
Fuck this shit, you can find me in the moshpit

Start a fucking moshpit!

You come unto me just to question my roots
But you could never walk a day in my shoes
Been in the game for twelve years, what it do?
Fuck this shit, you can find me in the moshpit 

Fake ass posers all around me
They don't know shit
Back off bitch, I'm the king of the moshpit
Said you love the music
But you never show your face, bitch 

Fuck this shit, you can find me in the moshpit"
Metal,"Open road has endless ways to move along
Hearts of gold can sometimes turn to stone
I live my life with the best intentions, always meant this
Oh, I keep my mind, never fenced in, always open ended

I keep my mind always open ended

I am free to be everything you're, everything you're not
How can I welcome you with open arms, with your hands around my throat?
I am free to be everything you're, everything you're not
How can I welcome you with open arms, with your mind so closed?
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down.

I walk alone, it doesn't mean my heart is absent
I'm building roads and bridges while you're burning them down
And your heart is absent laying where you left it
I'll reconcile, but you'll fight me harder, fight me harder

I keep my mind, always open ended,

I am free to be everything you're, everything you're not
How can I welcome you with open arms, with your hands around my throat?
I am free to be everything you're, everything you're not
How can I welcome you with open arms, with your mind so closed?
Don't bring me down.

How can I welcome you with open arms, with your hands around my throat?
How can you open your mind, when you have it set in stone?

You'd rather cast me out to sea facedown afloat

I am free to be everything you're, everything you're not
How can I welcome you with open arms, with your hands around my throat?
I am free to be everything you're, everything you're not
How can I welcome you with open arms, with your mind so closed?

Hearts of gold, can sometimes turn to stone
I live my life with the best intentions, always meant this
So, I keep my mind, never fenced in, always open
So, don't bring me down."
Metal,"I always knew I'd never reach perfection,
and if I ever did then I wasn't trying hard enough.
Because there is always something more to reach for.

And every end is just the start to something else.
I think that if we ever stopped seeking out
what it is that keeps us growing,
then we'll never stop searching for the piece.
The heart that will keep us loving.

I'm always searching for

I'm always searching.
This path's not easy to walk upon.
I'm always seeking.
Knowing that I'm eager to carry on.
I'm searching, seeking, reaching for something more.
I'll be better than before.
Reaching for something more

So if we keep seeking out what is right,
moving on after being set back,
searching out what keeps us strong.
Searching out, and always building up the things that we lack.
This path we choose is not the easiest to walk upon
And knowing that I am more eager to continue on
because I know that when I reach the end
I'll be better than before

Reaching for something more
I'm always searching

I'm always searching
This path's not easy to walk upon
I'm always seeking
Knowing that I'm eager to carry on
I'm searching, seeking, reaching for something more
I'll be better than before
Reaching for something more"
Metal,"My fall draws near.
My life fell out of my hands and into
This hole where everything's cold
I lose the feeling of guilt
There's
nothing inside, my innocence died.
And now the emptiness grows, it's
bringing me down and taking my crown
I've seen where everything's dark.
It's here in my soul, I'm losing control.
CHORUS:
Have mercy on me.
Have mercy on me.
Have mercy on me for every thorn I've driven in.
Within these walls you'll see
Alone in here - the end.
Before my very last day I'm making it stop.
I'm turning it off.
I'll fight the feeling I have until everything's
Gone
Resistance has won
Now time is healing these wounds and
You are still here releasing my fear
My life fell out of my hands
They
took it away, I'm taking it back.
(CHORUS)
And everyday I feel like this weight's
Constantly dragging me down
Broken for the last time (Never get the best of me, won't get the best of me)
I've got a heart of steel, but your words are
Constantly bringing me down.
I'm open for the first time (Never get the best of me, wont' get the best of me)
(CHORUS)
My fall drawns near."
Metal,"Existing on damnation's edge
The priest had never known
To witness such a violent show
Of power overthrown

Angels fighting aimlessly
Still dying by the sword
Our legions killing all in sight
To get the one called Lord

The Gates of Hell lie waiting as you see
There's no price to pay just follow me
I can take your lost soul from the grave
Jesus knows your soul can not be saved

Crucify the so called Lord
He soon shall fall to me
Your souls are damned your God has fell
To slave for me eternally
Hell awaits

The Reaper guard's the darkened Gates
That Satan calls his home
Demons feed the furnace where
The Dead are free to roam

Lonely children of the night
There's seven ways to go
Each leading to the burning hole
The Lucifer controls

Priests of Hades seek the sacred star
Satan sees the answer lies not far
Zombies screaming souls cry out to you
Satanic laws prevail your life is through

Pray to the moon, when it is round
Death with you shall then abound
What you seek, for can't be found
In sea or sky or underground

Now I have you deep inside my everlasting grasp
The seven bloody Gates of Hell
Is where you'll live your last

Warriors from Hell's Domain
Will bring you to your Death
The flames of Hades burning strong
Your soul shall never rest

The Gates of Hell lie waiting as you see
There's no price to pay just follow me
I can take your lost soul from the grave
Jesus knows your soul can not be saved

Sacrifice the lives of all I know they
Soon shall die
Their souls are damned to rot in Hell
And keep the fire growing deep inside
Hell awaits"

That's where I found my comfort
So I pick and chose my company
But one is a lonely number
I am all I've got
This is the breaking ground of what you are not
What happened to me again
I'm slipping through the cracks
I've seen the light, the [?]
Of reliving my past
And when will it ever stop?
It's very clear, my biggest fear is falling from the top
Falling from the top
I've had my days where I found peace
But I am falling back down
And I want to believe that the grass is green
There's only one way to find
Over and over and over again
This is unbelievable
From this day on, I am all I've got
What happened to me again
I'm slipping through the cracks
I've seen the light, the [?]
Of reliving my past
And when will it ever stop?
It's very clear, my biggest fear is falling from the top
All I want is to be adored
Find someone who wants nothing more
When I was young, [?] and pushed away
And that's why I wanted all this fame
(Wanted all this fame)
But you're to blame
Over and over and over again, and again

Metal,"I lied just a little
When I said I need you
You stretched the truth
When you said that you knew
Just can't believe it
There's nothing to say
I was almost honest, almost
Living alone, can't stand this place
It's four in the morning and I still see your face
I was nearly pure
When I said I Loved you
You were semi-sincere
You said I'd bleed for you
We were kind of candid
Now you've gone away
You were almost honest, almost
Living alone, falling from grace
I want to atone, but there's just empty space
I can't face tomorrow, now you're not coming back
Walked off in the night and just left me the tracks
I question the call by the tone of your voice
I know I should hang up but I don't have a choice
It happened that night when you told me to go
Don't ask whose to blame, I don't know
Almost, almost honest
Almost, I was almost honest"
Metal,"(They) searched for love under the moonlight
Sailed on the storm, they touched the sea
(All) hell broke loose, they felt the cold wind blow
On the wings of the cold and rainy shore

Looks like nothing hasn't changed,
""Love, hate, war"" it still remains
Lost in the world, like ice melts in the sun
But they'll carry on

Under the gun
Under the gun
Under the gun
And they carry on and on

A world of peace still to remember
They broke the chains to set us free
Lost in the world, like ice melts in the sun
But they'll carry on

Under the gun

And they carry on and on
And on!

Metal,"Death throes the seeds of lightning
Thunder cast in rain
Castrate humanity
The woman smells the game
Complete in time intact
And weave another year
Demand apocalypse
And do not despair

IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT

Danger approaches hold on tight
Ye ancient souls
The hounds are pacing
Out in distant roles
Bring in the alchemist
And screaming mortal witch
Sample the moonlight
And dance with the bitch

In the dead of the night
Children start to die
In a manger of blood
Dead is the night

Death sows the seeds of lightning
Thunder cast in rain
Castrate humanity
The woman smells the game
Complete in time intact
And weave another year
Hold your heads up high
Do not despair

Darksome night and ardent moon, The chalice is passed, then ye fall North; Hearken to the enchantress' rune-- Listen to the words to cry ye forth. Earth and water, ether and fire, Wand and pentacle and sword, Toil ye unto our desire, Hearken ye unto our word. Unfettered and censet, scourge and knife, Powers of the enchantress' blade-- Waken all ye into life, Come ye as the charm is made."
Metal,"Alone in the dark
Flashing the shadow surround us all
Spread our wings in the dust
When the sorrow feeds all the pain
Bound for paradise

Freegom will rise
Tender voices will sing for us all
In silence
Stand up and fight
Climb the stairway we'll reach our aim
Far horizons

Holy one, you' re love that you share
saves us from despair

Living in a fairyland
Oasis of light
And the time stands still
In a world full of pride
Living in a fairyland
In the hands of the one
And the time stands still
The island is my home

Watch out the stairway never ends
We will find the right way to light
Ever more, forever more I pray
And a shining starlight leads me on my way
Holy one 
In our dreams you' re alive
An island to survive

Heading for tomorrow
Sadness has an end
Where the world is free of sorrow
Children reign the land
And the master will come from somewhere
To ear our chains apart
In his golden eyes that I stare
With pleisure in my heart again"

aw...aw...aw drop that shit
straight comin' at ya, punk
the greatest side is critical
when digging on my concept rhythms

smothered with the freestyle
maybe it's the thought
of being on the bottom of the pile

when I spill pollution,
you preach the noise
about the words that you don't wanna hear
pollution, I keep that grip real tight breaker,

running through your mind

let me know you're real ??????

I rumble like the thunder
now you're going under

I can't refrain
from bringing on the pain

The grass is always greener on the other side
Fear of never having enough, dreams that turns into rust
Sometimes it's better to leave things alone
The road to success is hard and cold

I'm turning into something I don't wanna be
I've got a feeling that something is changing me
I can not let it all slip away
It's driving me insane

I don't wanna be nothing
Time is ticking, I feel stranded
I don't wanna be nothing
Make it go away

Fighting the battle that's growing within
It doesn't matter if I lose or win
It's getting to the point where I can't get away
I can not let it all slip away
It's driving me insane

I don't wanna be nothing
Time is ticking, I feel stranded
I don't wanna be nothing
Make it go away

I don't wanna be nothing
Hate is growing inside of me
I don't wanna be nothing
I'm taking back what used to be mine

I can't believe my luck is bleeding
My demons refuse to let me go
The light in the tunnel I see is fading
My fire of life is burning low (so low)

I don't wanna be nothing
Time is ticking, I feel stranded
I don't wanna be nothing
Make it go away

I don't wanna be nothing
Hate is growing inside of me
I don't wanna be nothing
I'm taking back what used to be mine

I don't wanna be nothing
Take me from this hell I'm in
I don't wanna be nothing
My whole life I've been the only enemy

I don't wanna be nothing
Hate is growing inside of me
I don't wanna be nothing
I'm taking back what used to be mine

Metal,"Rest assured they're weighing words in sympathetic ink
And they don't waste their time suspending disbelief
They face the facts with thinking caps, they map out and display
But that's not the only way

Common sense won't pay the rent and doesn't grow on trees
But splitting hairs can get you anything you need
Who would have thought connecting dots might get you to the point?
But charities and remedy, almost as much as modesty

Take the bait and save however much it takes
Before you've made your wish, however much it takes

Rest assured they're weighing words in sympathetic ink
And I don't waste my time suspending disbelief
Masterminds want bottom lines to map out and display
If I have every bit of faith I won't be turning in my grave

Take the bait and save however much it takes
Before you've made your wish, however much it takes

Take your own advice before you take a side
Run for middle ground

Take the bait and save however much it takes
Before you've made your wish, however much it takes
Before you lie in bed, however much it takes"

And life is just made of glass.
Mark the words of the fool
He will tell you the truth, oh so cruel.

You say and I will believe
Although I stumble and fall.
Deceived by my own eyes.
Trust is a gamble with pain, roll the dice! 

Give my your confidence
And I'll lock the door.
Offer me the same
And I'll be busted to the floor.

Or ride the light of day.
Dance with flames of fire,
You will burn with the words, of the liar."

Reflect the dawn of gods
Of ancient pantheons

The invincible.

See the signs in the day and the night,
Foretell the one, the one.

Open up the runa of belief of the strong and the brave
Open up! let the gods of your heart and your soul show the way.

Have seen the dawn of gods
In the well of mimera

Now I'm through, what a life
Because now I'm a freeman

As I look around I couldn't remember my old home
Now there's a tower block in its way
I remember all my friends and my wife
They don't want to know me anymore
They wouldn't listen, they didn't understand
They accused me of crime I didn't commit
It was some other guy, but it wasn't me
They wouldn't give in, they wouldn't believe me

In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream

Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

And was buried along with her name

From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

Not within the others, turn on the watchful eye

Dare to disassociate and cut the binds that tie
Abstractualize further to the ends of facts and foe
Will it out of meaning as silence speaks the truth

Stand atop the pantheon of fiction and your failure
Grasping for a hiding place among indifferent stones
A brief reflection, it sets the soul apart
No selection, it tears our world apart

These walls are protecting us, burn them to the ground
This haven of refuge, burn it to the ground

So smudge the lens a little, muffle the voice
Phase out of sound a while and let it go
Citizens of choice in a twilight world of your design 
Left to our devices we stumble on

Burn it to the ground

Burn it to the ground

Thousandfold the agony of silenced screams alone
Tune right out of static
Exorcise the dark
How else can we move on"

So does the pain

No more words to say
Find me in the circle
Find me in the end

I am the soul collector
Dressed in ebony
There are no rules
But only one

There's someone young sister,
Caught at the border
Let's get in contact
He's either yours or mine

I have thought
That this will never end
And things go on
But nothing will last
Only the fool in me believes
There is sense in it
In distant shores of green
It's over now

Far out in space
I ride on
Time is chasing us all
It's not quite how it seems
It's just a dream

I don't believe
In a soul or in god

It's just twisted
Further
You do not understand:

Each single breath inspires you
Come to an end - expire

Rise up my sister
Let's cross the border
Reveal the secret
One more to burn

I have thought
That this will never end
And things go on
But nothing will last
Only the fool in me believes
There is sense in it
In distant shores of green
It's over now

You finally have approached
Still
There is something left to do:
Draw me and prove
Your souls not ripe, yet!
Prepare yourself then wait for me
Expect the day when I come by
You're released now
For a while you may feel
Resurrection
Open your eyes

The vision's bleak 
And the color is black
Far Beyond
There's a starving
But dying sun

I have thought
That this will never end
And things go on
But nothing will last
Only the fool in me believes
There is sense in it
In distant shores of green
It's over now"

Holds the key to his own death
Entering a tomb of a corpse yet conceived
Tighten the tourniquet around your neck
 
Sifting away the debris of hated life
Cold touch of death begins to chill your spine
Seeking life beyond your perishment
Repeating words echoing through your mind
 
Chanting lines of blind witchery
To save yourself from extinction
Wanting to die is your reason to live
New life born from the oppressed
 
Taste your blood as it trickles through the air
Another casualty beyond the shadows you fall
Losing ground, the fate you feel it draws near
Fatality, reality, you await the final call
 
My sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts of death behind it
Skeletons in my mind commence tearing at my sanity
Vessels in my brain carry death until my birth
Come and die with me forever
Share insanity
 
Do you want to die!
 
The waves of blood are rushing near, pounding at the walls of lies
Turning off my sanity, reaching back into my mind
Non-rising body from the grave showing new reality
What I am, what I want, I'm only after death"
Metal,"Tell you something clearly 
Tell you something real 
But you tell me nothing 
You never do nothing real 
Your kind it keeps on cutting

Division you create now its all exploding soon 
Nothing left to break no hope in complaining 
All this lay in ruin its a time for mending
Gathering of the wounds"
Metal,"You're not the right one dumb damn rapper
Not the right goddamn
Who are you to rap shit take off
And who says you're right
On top you think you'r bomb artista
But you're bent out of oooo right
Suck my dick
But don't you think that you're oooo right
Sometimes things might make me ooo ooo it makes me mad
And when it happens fuck it
Rugged in mind a hint by bite
Why does it not exist in you?
Right, shit, why hit in yet another day
Woo hoo right
It's not woo hoo right
But you'r wrong
Twist Twist Twist Twist
Put me in right now make mad
Prove that you're right
Somehow you're not right, huh
But that doesn't make me mad
Right now you're beggin' for a little brew
All night
Yeah it's so simple
I had some Red Dog, you hand over it
Twist Twist Twist."
Metal,"Lies are spoken
When the venom crawls inside
Faith is broken
When the fire fills our eyes
Love lies hopeless
When the hate becomes the high
Pain is chosen
When the devil comes alive
(Daylight falls)
So save yourself
I leave this world tonight
There's nothing left
I see the sun rise
My dying breath
I keep this prayer alive
Rain is closing
When you're caught between the lines
Faith is forfeit
When the hollow fills our eyes
Hate lies hopeless
When the heart and soul divide
Pain is worthless
When the shadow comes alive
(Daylight falls)
So save yourself
I leave this world tonight
There's nothing left
I see the sun rise
My dying breath
I keep this prayer alive
So save yourself
I leave this world tonight
There's nothing left
I see the sun rise
My dying breath
I keep this prayer alive"
Metal,"I lost more I ever gained far away, far away... Thunder die, heartache cry Star-crossed light never meant far, far away... Whisper trance-enchants and fear! Light and fags, hope and fear Start to think and start to hear my voice soft, wit and charm Off I rise, twilight-path Never saw such trembling harm Cut-tongued spheres to appear falling down so fresh and free Flat my voice, wake or sleep I have met within my dreams Never feel a calm so deep How can grief break the wall to my long, long promised way? But my sake I will break, break in pieces never seen Senca, nevermore... Beauty, pleasure, youth which one will I choose to uphold my wounds? Beauty, pleasure, youth two of them to lose to avoid my tomb"
Metal,"On the edge of reason, beyond understanding
Silent she waits, perfect oblivion
She's crawling to the end, perfect oblivion
I live behind mirrors within a prison without any bars
Yet I remain lost to the world
In hell I'm suspended within a prism
So many walls, so many years, so many lives
Too often I've watched them die
Images of yesterday feeling so far away
I can't let go of the past, the years, the sweet romance
I am a ticking time bomb waiting in a trance
I need you more tonight than you will ever know
I swear to never forget this heartbreaking dance
The hell of being trapped is simply not a match for death
Heaven awaits
Now I know not to be afraid of the end
My love awaits, will you be there? Take me away
I'm ready, I'll be home soon
Images of yesterday feeling so far away
I can't let go of the past, the years, the sweet romance
I am a ticking time bomb waiting in a trance
I need you more tonight than you will ever know
I swear to never forget this heartbreaking dance
Beautiful pure silence, come on! Embrace me
Sweet perfect nothing swallow my fears, come on!
If I had just one wish I'd choke prophets
Hang angels, burn children
Oh, I'd drink oceans, eat the moon
Flood the world, end everything
Breathe in, breathe out
We could run far away but then how would we sleep at night?
I've been looking for the words to say our last goodbyes
Hold on to fleeting hopes that I just might survive
Give in to the pleasure
Make it last forever
Hold on hold on to everything we are"
Metal,"You give them hell
Straight to the chin
If you can't win
Their hearts and minds
On the first try
Up and say aye
Aye
They'll listen

Fires are raging and the sirens scream
And your pathetic life has run out of road
If you were offered eternity
Would it slip through your fingers to wicked to hold? 
Rebel
Backslider
Reach higher
You give them hell
You give them

Hell this ain't no warning
You give'em hell because you must
It's a long hard road we're walking
Because this battle chose us
(You give them hell)
This battle chose us
This battle chose us

A gang of blood
And by killing so distilling
A simple plan
Never settle our true mettle
Yeah
They'll listen
Fires are raging and the sirens scream
And your pathetic life has run out of road
If you were offered eternity
Would it slip through your fingers to wicked to hold?

Hell, you give them hell

Hell you give them hell
You can't choose your battles, you can't choose your battles, this battle chose us

You can't choose your battles, you can't choose your battles, this battle chose us (you give'em hell)
This battle chose us, you can't choose your battles (you give'em hell)
This battle chose us, you can't choose your battles (you give'em hell)
This battle chose us, you can't choose your battles (you give'em hell)
This battle chose us

Metal,"If heaven is a place where the angels go,
Well then I've got a story to tell,
If heaven is a place where the angels go,
Then I guess you're going straight to hell!
Don't wanna leave you now or never,
Cause we're perfect together,
Never wanna be apart,
Dead to take on the simple life.
There was trouble for us when I came home early,
Never would expect to see this,
Its fit to say I could not believe my eyes,
You cracked a smile but had nothing to say,
So I made a list of on how you're going to pay!
I Locked you out,
Left you naked in the front yard,
Burned all of your clothes,
Having nothing can't be really hard,
Now I'm on the run,
I'd do it all again,
So Catch me if you can,
Cause, I took your car,
With your baby in the back seat,
Cracked your credit card,
Doing ten to deadbeat,
Baby now you know how much it hurts,
When I caught you in the act wearing nothing but a Little Smirk!
Now I feel better,
But its hard to forget,
I never think about looking back,
Cause time has no meaning when your free,
This is what you get,
Come on bitch,
Now I see who you really are,
Cause happiness is the best revenge
But caught red daddy with a grin on your face,
Didn't think you'd be easy to replace!
I Locked you out,
Left you naked in the front yard,
Burned all of your clothes,
Having nothing can't be really hard,
Now I'm on the run,
I'd do it all again,
So Catch me if you can,
Cause, I took your car,
With your baby in the back seat,
Cracked your credit card,
Doing ten to deadbeat,
Baby now you know how much it hurts,
When I caught you in the act wearing nothing but a Little Smirk!
Again and again and again and again and e-yeah....
If heaven is a place where the angels go,
Well then I've got a story to tell,
If heaven is a place where the angels go,
Then I know I'm going straight to hell!
I Locked you out,
Left you naked in the front yard,
Burned all of your clothes"
Metal,"Every time that I see you
I think that you're dumb
Every time that I see you

How come
Every time that I see you
I suck on my thumb
I suck on my thumb I love you"
Metal,"All orders to surrender are false
Eye on the target
Back to the wall
Your body's shaking
The mountain's too tall
You want to lie down and rest on Elysian fields
Carry you home, upon your shield

A mighty Spartan
You answer to none
You're on a field-trip and hell sounds like fun
You know that
The path is dirty to fortune and fame
You're sworn and ready to go down in flames

All orders to surrender are false!
All messages fabricated!
Our goal is the gate of the castle!
Unleash hell!

Vultures fly
And we'll make it worse
Drowning out the light
Out of sight
It's just like a curse
Drowning out the light

You're God's own soldier
The lost and found son
War is your calling
It has to be won
You want to show your daddy
You're all grown up and strong
But the journey proved to be too long

Vultures fly
And we'll make it worse
Drowning out the light
Out of sight
It's just like a curse
Drowning out the light

Eyes on the target
Back to the wall
You motherfucker, you are killing us all

I watch angels fall from the sky
Every time that the sun still sets
I pray they don't take mine

I say goodbye to my weakness

Or read in a magazines
Celebrities that want sympathy
All they do is piss and moan
Inside the rolling stone
Talkin' about how hard life can be
I'd like to see them spend a week
Livin' life out on the street
I don't think they would survive
If they could spend a day or two
Walking in someone else's shoes
I think they'd stumble and they fall
(they would fall, fall)
Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complainin'
Always complainin'
If money is such a problem
Well they got mansions
Think we should rob them
Well did you know when you were famous you could kill your wife
And there's no such thing as 25 to life
As long as you've got the cash, to pay for Cochran
And did you know if you were caught and you were smokin' crack
McDonalds wouldn't even wanna take you back
You could always just run for mayor of D.C.
I'd like to see them spend a week
Livin' life out on the street
I don't think they would survive
If they could spend a day or two
Walking in someone else's shoes

Enter life of what's still here
Close the door away from near
Shrouded in autumn's graven ascension
Thought the bridge was over now
Lost the track astray somehow
Who's painting my life in sorrow blue
A relief for a dislocated mind
Shelter for thoughts
Asylum for my soul
Finding the only place I need to know
Salvation for a lonely sinking kind
All my duties be done
A few years of take
Never leaving again you're forever"
Metal,"O my sweet nurse
Pull the curtain aside for a while
So that I can for once have
The sun in my eye
You smile and say
It's a fine day

O my sweet nurse
Pull the curtain aside for a while

You come around all dressed in white
Talking to me
And so I have to drink
The water with your poison spilled
For no more will

O my sweet nurse
Seems you have so little time
That you rather put
Me to sleep than sit by my side"

So what if I wanna be numb all the time?
I can't justify why I'd wanna go slower
Taking my time just ain't my style, yeah

I'm feelin ok with my whiskey hangover

So what you cleaned your act up so far
So what if I'm pissing into the wind (again)?
Have you ever thought that I'm not who you are? (baby)
'cause even when I lose I know how to win again and again
So sick of you preaching all the time
Just keep your shitty advice inside

I waste my time whenever I like
I'm feelin ok with my whiskey hangover
Oh yeah yeah
'cause I walk dead or alive
I waste my time whenever I like
I'm feelin ok with my whiskey hangover
Oh yeah
Oh yeah!!
Lets go!

One sip ain't gunna do shit
On the 2nd sip I begin to admit
That the 3rd one down is what makes me feel alright
And number 4 I slam down to the floor
By 5 I'm ready to fight all night
And then 6, 7, 8 to make me break your face sometimes

'cause I walk dead or alive
I waste my time whenever I like
I'm feelin ok with my whiskey hangover
Oh yeah yeah

I waste my time whenever I like

We're strong enough to fight mendacious laws

Well, you think it's love or something close
Do you recall?
You say I was sleeping
But I know what I saw

There were nights, I swear we flew
Dreaming in color
I was dreaming beside you
Now the sky has gone to gray
The colors have blurred
In this picture we made

Ask me once or twice
Well, they ring them bells
They're throwing rice at you and me
But it wasn't enough
Say what more could I be?

When there were nights, I swear we flew
Dreaming in color
I was dreaming beside you
Now the sky has gone to gray
The colors have blurred
In this picture we made

I sleep all day and watch TV all night
The pictures play in black and white
I close my eyes
I close my eyes 'cause

There were nights, I swear we flew
Dreaming in color
I was dreaming beside you
Now the sky has gone to gray
The colors have blurred
In this pictures we made

life's making you choke
life's making you drown
get away from the pain now

Don't become something you despised when you started

Starting arguments with the ghosts of people still alive
I knew exactly what you wanted, I pretend to want the same
Another reason that I'm haunted by what could have been
I feel dead in myself and I can't feel alive in anyone else

If it made you hurt, made you feel so much
It must be love that I gave up

What if this version of me
Gave up today on who it could be?
I know I'm still broken because
I can't fix myself with somebody else that's breaking

Whether you believe you can or can't change
I guess that you'll be right either way
The dark can't keep hiding in darkness
It's gotten harder to see

If it made you hurt, made you feel so much
It must be love that I gave up

What if this version of me
Gave up today on who it could be?
I know I'm still broken because
I can't fix myself with somebody else that's breaking
What if we could just escape from our situations?
Out of our heads, let our hearts do the heavy lifting

Broken I've lied,
Pick up the pieces,
You'll try to live for yourself
How can you live for yourself?
Live how you wish,
But live as if you'll die today

I won't stop until I can reach you
And get this off my chest
A sense of direction,
To lead you home again
I'm alone

Mind your tongue
And save your breath for someone else
You won't believe me,
We're not the same 'cause I dig
And I dig you, too
Confirmed in writing,
I will fight for the sake of you
I will fight for this

Dream if you'll live forever,
Dream for me
Broken down,
I've tried to pick up the pieces
You lied
You live for yourself

There's no compromise
Changing seasons
Living the high life
I don't know you
So don't freak on me
I can't control you
You're not my destiny

Straight out of line
I can't find a reason
Why I should justify my ways
Straight out of line
I don't need a reason
You don't need to lie to me

I'll confess this
You're my tragedy
I paid you to rest just
As fast as you turned on me
Gone forever
Banish the memories
Displays of pleasure
Are masked by your misery

Straight out of line
I can't find a reason
Why I should justify my ways
Straight out of line
I don't need a reason
You don't need to lie to me
Lie to me

Straight out of line
I can't find a reason

You don't need to
You don't need to lie to me
Lie to me
Lie to me

Metal,"All your beliefs filled up with lies
Blinded from what you call prophets
Your Jihad's a joke, revenge is our fight
We'll crush the Al Quaeda to stop it

Drop the bombs in
Drop the bombs in
Wipe out your muthafucking schemes
Bring the troops in
Bring the troops in
Wipe out your minority

World has united to weed out the scum
Our people have all took a stand
We're tired of your bullshit, the actions of few
That threaten the future of man

Drop the bombs in
Drop the bombs in
Wipe out your muthafucking schemes
Dig the roots out
Dig the roots out
Your holy war is nothing to be proud

A call to arms
This call for pride
You can never take from what we feel inside
All our strength
Is in our hearts
This is our call to arms"
Metal,"Another day, Another lied, More hopes and words And thoughts black as a nite Another place Another time Another needing and bleeding and pleading And such like You can't explain I can't deny We can't take off, blow off The sins kept us alive You felt great You felt fine But I stumbled so humbled Seeking any good sign I don't sink, I will not crack!!! I won't bleed, I'm on my straight way back!!! I close my eyes I disappear i stopped the time, in time So I could eat my fear No farther steps No looking on And no feeding, exceeding, proceeding And so in I won't sink I won't crack But go away, get away I won't turn you back And all is said And all is done And all the gains and losses Burned in The Almighty Sun I don't sink, I will not crack!!!

Metal,"Rounded up, herded in, innocence served.
Tortured, various phases, in witness of family you die.

Hot steel prods into your eyes.
Executioner nods, optics spew.
Tanks roll foreword claiming lives.
Focus of death, nothing new.

Innocent families left to die.
Soldiers murder, God defied.
Iron fist falls heavy with lust.

Systematic execution.
Playing God with his thoughts.
No retribution.
Forever the souls will haunt.
Systematic execution.

Military machines, steel warped with hate.
Death from above, precision bombing translates final acts.
Engines whine, tear through the night.
Weary low morale, caught up in the sights.

Soldiers march, take your land.
Resistance end in slaughter.

Dying screams clutter the sands.
Echoing sounds, chaotic laughter.
The sun is killed, behind a blackened sky.
The son is killed, a father watches him die.

Systematic execution.
Playing God with his thoughts.
No retribution.
Forever the souls will haunt.

Wings of death carry your carcass into the realms of terror.
Crushed beneath the wheels of war.
Doctrine of greed violently implored."
Metal,"I was caught
In the middle of a railroad track (thunder)
I looked round
And I knew there was no turning back (thunder)
My mind raced
And I thought what could I do (thunder)
And I knew
There was no help, no help from you (thunder)

Sound of the drums
Beatin' in my heart
The thunder of guns
Tore me apart
You've been thunderstruck

Went down the highway
Broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas, yeah Texas
And we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah, yeah, they, they, they blew our minds

I was shakin' at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yeah, the ladies were too kind
You've been thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, thunderstruck

Oh, thunderstruck, yeah

Now we're shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?

Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah

Said yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine
Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine

Metal,"I'm your forsaken, the fallen from grace
Horror of evil, created mistake
Ruthless and wicked, I feast with the damned
I am the cyst on your lord's holy lamb

Fuck your religion with blood on its hands
Forgive the savior, forget about man
Profits for heaven build kingdoms of greed
Whoring redempter, embezzle the weak

I am no one, without me he's unknown
Darkness gives power to light up his throne
Descend on earth in angelic display
The time has come to undo his restrains

I'm the temptation that swallowed his eve
god's inhibition leave nothing to see
Hatred and anger conceived from the dust
I am the shame and the filth of their lust

Forfeit the savior for cleansing of sins
Relive the site of his crucifixion
Tragedy follows the wealth of your faith
Holy disorder has fell into place

Banished from heaven, unsatisfied soul
Out of the way of Jehovah's control
Let upon earth to envoke its decay
The time has come for your god to take blame"
Metal,"Drones since the dawn of time
Compelled to live your sheltered lives
Not once has anyone ever seen
Such a rise of pure hypocrisy
I'll instigate I'll free your mind
I'll show you what I've known all this time 

God hates us all, god hates us all
You know it's true god hates this place
You know it's true he hates this race 

Homicide-suicide
Hate heals, you should try it sometime
Strive for peace with acts of war
The beauty of death we all adore
I have no faith distracting me
I know why your prayers will never be answered 

God hates us all, god hates us all
He fuckin' hates me 

Pessimist, terrorist targeting the next mark
Global chaos feeding on hysteria
Cut throat, slit your wrist, shoot you in the back fair game
Drug abuse, self abuse searching for the next high
Sounds a lot like hell is spreading all the time
I'm waiting for the day the whole world fucking dies 

I never said I wanted to be god's disciple
I'll never be the one to blindly follow 

Man made virus infecting the world
Self-destruct human time bomb
What if there is no god would you think the fuckin' same
Wasting your life in a leap of blind faith
Wake the fuck up can't ignore what I say
I got my own philosophy 

I hate everyone equally
You can't tear that out of me
No segregation separation
Just me in my world of enemies 

I never said I wanted to be god's disciple
I'll never be the one to blindly follow
I'll never be the one to bear the cross-disciple 

I reject this fuckin' race
I despise this fuckin' place"
Metal,"Lasciviously they move
Two powers bound for unity
Like magnets, they align, under immunity
The product of their congress, their libidinous deed
Insatiable mouth of conflict and greed

Beware the soon to be born bringer of pain

One evil by another inseminated
Pure hatred conceived
The pairing of blood and power
A spawn of harm produced
Death and profit begotten, fused

A ghost-producing offspring. Immorality's embodiment
Spite and disgust incarnate. A progeny insane

Tar-black ejaculate
The seminal bile of conspiracy
The blood of those who died
Their innocence, their marrow

The pursuit of ruin. Murderous ambition
Bloodshed, the careless taking of lives
A conduct symbolic of its condition

Behold the newborn monstrosity
Descendant of avarice
Indifferent war machine in all its violent glory
A callous iron god born to reign

Tar-black ejaculate
The seminal bile of conspiracy
The blood of those who died
Their innocence, their marrow"
Metal,"You sit at home feeling so strong from behind that screen,
But honestly do you think those words you're typing are gonna change anything?
Could it be this is just an escape from all your insecurities?
Could it be your deepest secret is you wish that you were me?

Tell me what is it with this love to hate?
I think I'm starting to lose all my faith.
This isn't how it's supposed to be!

You see everything in black and white.
Who are you to tell me what's wrong or right?
What could I possibly learn from someone like you?
You don't know the first thing about my life!

Say what you will.
You know it all or at least you think you do.
Waste all your days complaining.
You think we care but everyone knows that you don't have a clue,
So say what you will
But you wouldn't last a day in my shoes!
Waste all your days complaining.
You think we care but this is a war you will always lose.

So go and disregard the blood, sweat and tears we shed for you,
But who will have the upper hand
When this is over and I've done everything you wished you could do.

Stop wasting my time,
So full of things to say when you feel safe.
Maybe I'll listen to you whine
The day you wanna say it to my face.

Bring it on!

So many mouths that love to run,
But I just laugh because I've been confronted by none.

Say what you will.
You know it all or at least you think you do.
Waste all your days complaining.
You think we care but everyone knows that you don't have a clue,
So say what you will
But you wouldn't last a day in my shoes!
Waste all your days complaining.
You think we care but this is a war you will always lose.

Say what you will.

You think we care but everyone knows that you don't have a clue,
So say what you will
But you wouldn't last a day in my shoes!
Waste all your days complaining.
You think we care but this is a war you will always lose!

I'm calling out my generation.
This is an alarm!
Can you hear it now?
It seems like caring is just a phase we're over now.

I'm calling out my generation.
You should be ashamed
'Cause you're the ones to blame.
This isn't how it's supposed to be."
Metal,"Traitors and rapists, defilers of maids Betrayed to the dead man's will Desacreted our homeland with scorn Once where we lived in peace Inferiority, disguised in supremacy Humiliated will, descend upon you!

Metal,"If one day you'd backed up a promise you made
We'd have to make it a holiday
'Cause we both know that day would never come again
If one day your word was as good as gold
It'd be too late 'cause I'd be too old
I don't think a human being could live that long

I never gave a damn
I was never even a fan
The only thing that makes me smile if your pain
I don't even care
When did you treat anyone fair?
To say I'm not enjoying this would be insane

Sodium Pentathol was an idea I had
But what does the truth mean now
To all the lost souls you've grabbed

A mass delusion, there's no confusion
Just a hypocrite
Who'd never cop to it

You're in total control and you're still a liar
I can't drink from the cup
I question your authority
You gotta 'fess up
You're in total control and your faith is tired
I can't drink from the cup
Where is truth in the trinity
You gotta 'fess up

If the affects you it's hard to tell
You spent too many cold days in your cell
Never been one to admit that something, might be wrong

I never gave a damn
I was never even a fan
The only thing that makes me smile is your pain
If I ever had the chance
I'd kick out your chair just to watch you dance
Irrelevant, your vanity prevents change

Sodium Pentathol still sounds great to me
An imitation of life buried in theology

A mass delusion, there's no confusion
Just a hypocrite
Who'd never cop to it

You're in total control and you're still a liar
I can't drink from the cup
I question your authority
You gotta 'fess up
You're in total control and your faith is tired
I can't drink from the cup
Where is truth in the trinity
You gotta 'fess up

Cop to it
You're in total control and you're still a liar
You're in total control and your faith is still
I can't drink from the cup
'Fess up"

Hunted, we're hunted down

Catching any moment, taping every sentence,

Analyzed, categorized for any later use

Metal,"Words unspoken, sworn in secrecy
A burning flame for the ones who believe
The prophecy

Revelations from the sun as of the moon
In seven nights we became history
The prophecy

On a cold dark night
We set our sails to search for land so far away
Searching for the truth

There's a howl in the wind
On this mystic trail of water we sail on
The source of youth

And the storm breaks loose on the seven seas
Tag on the signs on the mounting sun

Northern light is shining on for us
Breaking the ice in search for tomorrow
Setting the sails into the future
Leave all your fears and your sorrows

From the mountain side
Came a twisted wind, it brought us new insight
Whispering these words

Come in the midst you'll see
Said a voice, I thought it was the prophecy
The secrecy unheard

And on the violent sea there's tranquility
We saw the signs on the mountain side

Northern light is shining on for us
Breaking the ice in search for tomorrow
Setting the sails into the future
Leave all your fears and your sorrows

A secret passage never to be found
In front of us a delusion of sight
The prophecy

From the mountains and the rivers down below
A silent breeze, there's a wail in the wind
The prophecy

We've come from a land so far away
We bow down to the words you pray
Storming down the mountain side
No place to go, no place to hide

Here we stand under of cover the moonlight
Oh, the prophecy was bound to fail
Here we are, nowhere to be found
We're trapped in another world and the journey's just begun

Ah, ah, ah"
Metal,"Daylight is waving goodbye
Darkness is here throwing sand in your eye
What can you do, where can you hide?
I just wonder

Light in your room's turning red
ready to find monsters under your bed
Dreams just fall apart
Chill from the inside is touching your heart

Round and round wind of time's gonna follow you
Round and round stealing year after year
Every night it will overpower you
Every night - face your fear

Build your illusions to last
Merciless time's gonna turn them to dust
Over the years just look what all of us've done
one to another as God to his son

Thousands of tricks up it's sleeve
playing with you like a wind with the leaf
Making you scream every day:
""Take me down, just take me away!"""
Metal,"Where have you been?
My life's not the same without you in it
My love I've watched you disappear
Right before my eyes
right before I told you how i felt
no I must thank you now
For the things you've done
you helped me fight my demons
like a mother to her son
Whoa where have you been
my life's not the same without you in it
Whoa forever I'll wait
your live and affection is all that I crave
I long for your kiss and your memory still remains
My heavy heart you carried on your back
and right before your eyes
I stood back up and picked up all the slack
my love I have done my best to
hold my head up high ill never be the same
without you in my life
Whoa where have you been
my life's not the same without you in it
Whoa forever I'll wait
your live and affection is all that I crave
I long for your kiss and your memory still remains
Blood in blood out

Prop me up and see my soul is aching 
Take the dirt upon the ground around me 
Bury me inside the grave I built for you 

Walk into the room - Feel my stare of doom 
Scars that line my face - Lies cannot replace 

I can see through you 
And I'll tell you

All my life I've heard a thousand lies
Seen myself through someone else's eyes 

Kill you with my words - Get what you deserve 

I can see through you 
And I'll tell you 

All my life I've heard a thousand lies 
Seen myself through someone else's eyes 

Remember what you did to me? 
For you know I won't forget 
Now you've broken everything 
Is your heart filled with regret? 

All my life I've heard a thousand lies

Show me your face.
A violence society?

Teach it to my mom.
You get your ass kicked.
The destroyer of the anachronism.

Though it became such a result now.
It was loved.
Absorb fear and die.
Know all the pain given to it.
Absorb fear and die.
Die staring at yourself.
Tell me a truth and a lie.
Am I being deceived?
Who is an enemy?
Tell me...
Obedience is the sign of death.
Think firmly with your brain.
Obedience is the sign of death.
Prosecute a man folly.
Tell me a truth and a lie."

Different every second

It's itching and bleeding
Layer by layer
I'm peeling away

Burn down my house
And make something happen
Stab me in the heart

And make something stop
Cause I am so distracted
I am slightly shocked
By how things can keep going
Like a dead man's clock

A mirror is hanging
Kinda loose on my wall
I'm passing it sideways
I'm saying hello

My brother is halfways
Through a book I've left him
Called me today
To see what I'd say"

I love my evil genius
Nothing can come between us
I'm in love with a genius
God knows she's a genius

She's goin' make, she's goin' make, make the world go
I can't escape, I can't escape so I find hope
She's goin' make, she's goin' make, make the world go
I can't escape, I can't escape so I find hope
She's goin' make, she's goin' make, make the world go
She's goin' make, she's goin' make, make the world go

Metal,"It won't help if you wait for me.
I'm a slave to the dark.
I know I'm not a saint, you see.
The dawn is when it starts.
Feel the shadow of my oblivion
hoping mercy would show her face
on the road to your own perdition
in the coal-blackened rain.
Frozen in time yearning forbidden wishes.
Damned and divine.
Scars of my broken kisses.
What will follow if tomorrow's blind?
My eternal night.
As the wind takes me away from you
before the morning light.
My sins are fading into view
I'm so weary deep inside
Feel the shadow of my oblivion
hoping mercy would show her face
on the road to your own perdition
I may see you again.
Frozen in time yearning forbidden wishes.
Damned and divine.
Scars of my broken kisses.
What will follow if tomorrow's blind?
My eternal night.
Every single dawn I die again."
Metal,"Speak your mind
Like I care
I can see your lips moving
I've just learned not to hear
Don't waste your time
It's never enough for you, baby
Don't want to play your game anymore
No matter what you say
I'm all out of love for you, baby
And now that I've tried everything
I'll numb the pain till I am made of stone
Take your time
I'm not scared
Make me everything you need me to be
So the judgement seems fair
Don't waste your time
It's never enough for you, baby
Don't want to play your game anymore
No matter what you say
I'm all out of love for you, baby
And now that I've tried everything
I'll numb the pain till I am made
To tear out my heart
For the way that it feels
I will still remember when you've long forgotten me
It's never enough for you, baby
Don't want to play your game anymore
No matter what you say
I'm all out of love for you, baby
And now that I've tried everything
I'll numb the pain till I am made of stone
It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough for you
I'll numb the pain till I am made of stone
I'll numb the pain till I am made of stone"

Metal,"Stranded alone on a barren island
No food to be found
Point of desperation
Shocking decision on how to survive
Now it's time to break out the knife
First incision the cut is complete
First source of food is one of your feet
Incredible pain as you cauterize the wound
Preparing yourself for a horrible doom

Amputation for your rations
Legs are gone, start new gashes

Half of your fingers are now cut away
To live through another agonizing day
Feasting on the rest of your arm
Next the slice goes across your throat"
Metal,"We are all here in the act of creation
Let's fly away on our imagination
You take me to the highest heights
and into the depths of the deepest abyss

When I am dreaming, I don't know if
I'm truly asleep or if I'm awake
And when I get up, I don't know if I'm
truly awake, or if I'm still dreaming

Dream, Dream, Dream, Dream, life is
but a dream
Traveling the waves of an infiinite ocean
I feel the deepest emotion
I see a shadow of reality
Please hold me closely and take me away

I'm the first person
you're the second person
Earlier today I was in the third person
Stop cursing, start diversing
Oedipus is bliss
the sunshine will affect your mind
Stretch it out, don't doubt the amount
my brain is caught
I'm just blessed
Trip hoppin', so I flow like a stream
It's just a dream"
Metal,"I hope you're doing fine out there without me
‘Cause I'm not doing so good without you
The things I thought you'd never know about me
Were the things I guess you always understood
So how could I have been so blind for all these years
I guess I only see the truth through all this fear of living without you
And everything I have in this world
And all that i'll ever be
It could all fall down around me
Just as long as I have you right here by me
I can't take another day without you
‘Cause, baby, I could never make it on my own
I've been waiting so long just to hold you
And to be back in your arms where I belong
I'm sorry I can't always find the words to say
Everything I've ever known gets swept away
Inside your love
And everything I have in this world
All that i'll ever be
It could all fall down around me
Just as long as I have you right here by me
As the days roll on I see
Some is standing still for me
And you're not here
I'm sorry I can't always find the words to say
Everything I've ever known gets swept away

Metal,If we give the horses blinders They won't see the approaching ledge Too much time and effort spent on just another bridge We trust the local doctor We trust the medicine Our child gets a scratch We give our child a brand new head We eat what's on our plate We drink what's in our cup We like the shiny tv screen It spits we lap it up And so they push this product And they know we'll buy it They sing a song We hum along We sing But we don't understand the words to the song And they fill our heads With sugar coated shit Cause there's no need to talk When we have medicine There's a pill for every fucked up thought And a cure for every fucked up child When the mind starts running Be sure it won't cross the finish line And if it wanders Bring it back and cage it for some time And if it stretches It will only one day rip To prevent excessive thought Just keep it up on the shelf And when the shelves are full And supplies are short And quickly running out You've got a thousand mindless zombies And terrified horses on your hands It was a damn good plan It was a damn good plan

not afraid of going home, if I never took my chances

Decayed rotten stench
Casualties are sent down
Nightmare has begun

Lambs to the slaughter
Waiting to die
Your land infested
Killer elite

Last day alive
Don't want to die
Unknown reason
Your race enslaved

Anger, hatred, brings out your savagery
Soldiers, bred to fight, conquer, dominate
Achive nothing when you try to resist
Perished are your rights,they mean nothing true

Leaders inhuman
Wearing your skin
Hours of torture
Off with your head

Images of bitter memories
As clear as a sheet of glass 
Games have died 
False beauty won't last 
Greed and hatred, 
Some will live
Left to wonder why
Confused, lost, alone 
Pressure now unleashed
See from my point of view
Vengeance for what you do
Issues have been long forgotten 
Lost, abandoned, 
Suffer as I do

Torment and mention, 
Ungodly choices
Act of violence, 
Pain in now real

Why decide right or wrong
There is another way 
You must decide for your own self
The path in which to go

Greed and hatred 
Some will live
Left to wonder why
You will forever
Suffer aching pain
Pressure now unleashed"

To never let you out of my hands
Nothing here could ever change this
A promise til the living end
I swore I'd never stray from you

Broken bones, broken in half
I've come too far to start again
But I'm trying, I am trying
I'm sick of this , I'm sick of hurt
Shame is such a dirty word
I'm trying, I'm still trying

Swore to never leave you
To never let you out of my hands
Nothing here could ever change this
A promise til the living end
I never meant to be a liar
The shame is cutting into my skin
I'd rather die on my feet
Than live here on my knees again
I swore I'd never stray from you

Swore I'd never stray from you"

Insane, malicious ill willed being
Grudge, a virulent disorder
Hatred to those who oppose your fate

Deranged evildoer

All was possible and God it felt so near
So I suffered and I bled, I truly did believe
Years have come and gone, but just where has it brought me

In the blink of an eye
Seems like minutes as the years fly by
In the blink of an eye
Afraid to stop because I can't stop time

Strobing snapshots of my past become a blurring flash
Just one thing can make it all come flooding back

If I'd stopped just once to look back maybe I would see
Just how far I've come, but it took it's toll on my

In the blink of an eye
Seems like minutes as the years fly by

Afraid to stop because I can't stop time

Blink of an eye

More and more and more

Track, crush and prevail
Now come, let's hunt for ersatz souls
Track, crush and prevail
Watch the blood turn your diamonds into coal

The science of darkness and we practice all its codes
Their values turn, they guide us on titanium roads
We must reduce ourselves in surgeries grace
We amputate our parts and let prosthetics replace

I know you feel it - you want it
More and more and more

Track, crush and prevail
Now come, let's hunt for ersatz souls
Track, crush and prevail
Watch the blood turn your diamonds into coal

Grab the claws - take my hand
Serve the cause - take command
I will show you my plan

Cut the ropes - come as free
Here's the gate - turn the key
I will let you be grand

Track, crush and prevail
Now come, let's hunt for ersatz souls

Fly from the haze
Jump on the prey
Scaring away

Roaming and stare
Lonely again
Perish the heat
Succumbing breath
Last but not least
Die or slay
Hide on the field
Perceiving eyes
Hunting the prey
In paradise
No one is to know
Secrets of your soul
No one knows for sure
Still I wonder why
I'm waiting, just waiting
Answers to return
Don't let your dreams deny you
When it's time to learn
I'm standing, I'm waiting
Time has no reverse
Can someone see them falling
Bones will feed the dirt
Hunters and Prey
You got to run away!

Yet I still stand in fear and suffering
Fear is the only end

Metal,"You smothered my beliefs to the point of nearly killing me When you gave me a name to carry with shame Show me mother, I've reached the point where I'm supposed to say Teach me again father, yet for some reason I am still waiting! Cast away now. Cut the moorings I've lived through the resurrection and can somehow say I'm on my way now, any day now Urged by my Katharsis In my world there's no bitterness I'm touched in more than one way, so natural, so beautiful!!! In my past world it was you who... You who triggered me... We need a burst of chaos to become clean and purified Neurotic cleansing disorder cease to be Venting emotions, my demons are alive Spiritual renewal, come come Katharsis"
Metal,"[music & lyrics: luca turilli]

Star... light... shine!

They are coming out from the ice
From the furthest deepest caves
Bringing real pain to all...
Leading black death to this world...
Creatures born from ancient fears
Trapped until this new mystic eclipse...
This new eclipse!
Now they know the ancient legend
Was not ramblings of old fools
""...when the fireball will so fall
We'll see a black night without moon...""

From this godforsaken place
Where the enemy has no face
I call the mystic starlight
To enlight my planet damned
In this requiem for my land
My prince of the
Starlight...
Starlght!

In the tragic daily events
There's no place for their true love
Love born from seed unknown...
Arkan's last pleasure and hope...
Cosmic journey of emotions
Between hearts of distant space...
Of distant time...
But the dark fight has to be won
If they want to live their lives
To defend their planet zaephyr
From the threat of deathly ice

From this godforsaken place
Where the enemy has no face
I call the mystic starlight
To enlight my planet damned
In this requiem for my land
My prince of the
Starlight...
Starlght!

Qui salvando salvas gratis"

Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't build nothing overnight
'Cause a love like this takes some time
People swore it off as a phase
Said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom
They see that we did that (yes)
It's so true that (yes)
We've been through it (yes)
We got real shit (yes)
See baby we been...

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home ('cause I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby

I got a question for ya
See I already know the answer

But still I wanna ask you
Would you lie? (No)
Make me cry? (No)
Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?
Well, neither would I, baby
My love is only your love (yes)
I'll be faithful (yes)
I'm for real (yes)
And with us you'll always know the deal
We've been...

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home ('cause I can't sleep without you baby)

Well, let me see you put your hands up
Fellas tell your lady she's the one (hands up)
Ladies let him know he's got your love (hands up)

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home ('cause I can't sleep without you baby)

Metal,"The art of war is of vital importance to the state.
It is a matter of life and death,
A road either to safety or to ruin.

To fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence
Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without having to fight

If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt
If you know heaven and you know Earth, you may make your victory

If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear results of a hundred battles
If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer defeat.
If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.

Treat your soldiers as your beloved children
And they will follow you into the deepest valleys.
To defeat your enemy, you must pretend inferiority and encourage your enemy's arrogance.

Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory
For it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.

There is no instance of a nation benefiting from prolonged warfare.

Speed is the essence of war.

The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy?s not coming, 
But on our own readiness to receive our enemy; 
Not on the chance of our enemies not attacking, 
But rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.

The general who advances without seeking fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, 
Whose only thought is to protect his country and do service for his sovereign, 
Is the jewel of his kingdom.

The victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won 
Whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.

Speed is the essence of war.
Speed is the essence of war.

It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war
Who can thoroughly understand how to profit from waging war.

Metal,"Wake up my friend
Today life will show the answers
It's time for you to face the risk
Dark clouds will go away
They know your fears
Cause your mind can't hide connections
And disturb the harmony
For you to let it fade
Let it out, let it go
Grab the chances
You've been waiting for so long
Let it out, take control
Find your way towards
The places you belong
Wake up my friend
You're in charge of your connections
It's time for you to face the day
Dark clouds were gone away
All the past?
Or maybe never seem to?
The minute you wake up
Let it out, let it go
Grab the chances
You've been waiting for so long
Let it out, take control
Find your way towards
The places you belong
I'll wait 'till the storm of emotions
Changes the tides
Afraid that the strong clouds of sorrow
Will haze my side and blind my eyes
Let it out, let it go
Grab the chances
You've been waiting for so long
Let it out, take control
Find your way towards
The places you belong
""Just wait the
Chances you've been waiting for so long
Please wait and find your
Way towards the places you belong"""
Metal,"Fucking coward, does it make you feel big
And strong to watch her cry out and bleed?
See the fear in her eyes, won't you kill the weakness in yours.
Motherfucker, vengeance comes soon.

You won't stand in front of me.
I'll avenge my family.
Been waiting these four years to destroy you,
To erase you from this place so we can breathe.

Don't want you as a memory.
Shadow, I'll cast you down.
You, you're just a bitch you think I'd let you forget?
Someday, our paths will cross, you're the one who will bleed.

Salvation from my hate.
Won't break my promise to the one who gave me this life.
I've been waiting these four years to get you out of my head.
You kill the memories, you kill the memories.

Won't kill this pain, your pain and memories.
Pain inside"
Metal,"Peço força, vejo lutas,
O que quero não recebo ou será que não percebo
Em meus Passos sempre à frente, o que faço, reclamar,
De onde me vem tanta ingratidão, de onde me vem tanta ingratidão
Seus braços abertos ignoram minha ingratidão,
Agora estou pronto a ouvir
Seus braços abertos ignoram minha ingratidão,
Agora estou pronto a ouvir

Mas você acreditou em mim
O seu amor tão singular infinito em sua imensidão,
Me acolheu, cuidou de mim."
Metal,"Down, start digging down your throat 
Another string of lies is born 
You must exemplify perfection 
Bronzing a broken life of shit 

You filthy liar 
Septic tongue; shit-eating grin 
Slow internal suicide 
An inch within a trigger's pull again 

This disease, it is your mainstay 
It wears its wires within me 
Tender tissues scraped away of secrets 
Etched in nameless graves 
The smell of vomit hangs in the air tonight 
Blush, eyeliner, lipstick 
It's all alright tonight 

You filthy liar 
Septic tongue; shit-eating grin 
Love me with your yellowed smile 
My flies are hungry for your kiss 

Poison me my darling 
Graves grow deeper with each passing day 
This appalling love 
Bask in your putrid revelry 
Beauty lost in between the lashes of sick drunken eye 

Like a fool, you have believed 
Life of shame, you have fallen completely beneath 

And when the curtains finally part, 
You'll see that everyone is laughing 
I am weakness, just like you 
I'll bury you before you're dead 

Cockroach come crawling home! 
Crawl! 
Slithering through this world of sculpted shit 
So thrust those fingers deep my child, 
It is your burden and your gift 

You filthy liar 
Septic tongue; shit-eating grin 
Slow internal suicide 
An inch within a trigger's pull again 

Poison me my darling

This appalling love 
Bask in your putrid revelry!"

Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere

Later's better than never
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive, drive

Metal,"Look in consternation as storms tear up the sea,
Raging down upon us with greatest might.
Gathering the power from above the clouds,
Blackening the sun away from sight. 

Gaze in frustration as ground becomes a void,
Forcing you towards the jaws of sand.
Your power is now shaken to its foundation,
Across every acre of your land. 

Fall to the ground after climbing so high,
Fall to your knees and yield for the sky.
As the primordial powers unveil,
From beyond time, nature prevails.
You can only stand in veneration. 

Stare in astonishment as earth spits
Out its core,
Covering your land in a burning wave.
Run for cover if you can
And save what can be saved,
Or the wave will become your grave. 

Behold in amazement, inferiously you stand.
The air becomes a fire right before your eyes.
The sparkling flame of envy is setting you alight,
As mother nature cracks the sky."
Metal,"This is our last goodbye
Young hearts will stop, torn souls set free
All that we have is now
If this is what you want then come to me
My argentina, my love
One final kiss 'til we meet again
Now I know what it's like
To live two lives and have to choose
Sorrow and song, they dance
Let them, for all the perfect nights with you
My argentina, my love
One final kiss 'til we meet again
I never asked for your love
You gave it all and now it's gone, oh, it's gone
I can't be obligated
I never said I was the one, one, the one
This is the winter of our lives
We come to play the final scene
The curtains close and in the darkness we expose
What lies beneath
You thought I needed someone
To be complete but you were wrong, oh, so wrong
I'm nothing more than who I am
Don't put it all in my hands
I never said that I could save you from yourself
But you took the chance
And this is how it ends
Games of revenge that no one wins
This is how it ends
We romanticize our pain
And justify our rage
We excuse ourselves and remove ourselves
From all the wars we wage
We call it love
Competition, foolish pride, taking sides
We call it love
Stabbing words manipulate
It's how we're taught to use and take
We call it love
When you look back on what you had, not what you lost
Then call it love
But this is how it ends
All things must come to an end
And in our place once we're forgotten
A new day will come
And the sun will shine again
But I don't know when"

Come back, back down now, I'm drifting away.
Your ship's sunk. It's gone down, now your captain is dead.
Your saints become sailors, when my ocean is fed by these,
Bloody waters, Mark my words. Come on.

Alright I want you call to clap along and sing with me:
When I said I'd fight back, I didn't say that I'd fight fair.
I said I'd fight back, I didn't say that I'd fight fair.

Salt your eyes, sleep with all the fishes.
The waves start the flood that's drowning yourself.
Broken, then we'll salt your eyes.
No wind, this sound.

Waves, make waves. 
Back down, stop drifting away.
Come back, come back, it's all you can take.
We'll pour salt in your eyes.

And endless breaking of faith can warrant acts of treason

Who is able to sift through the treasures from the flukes?

That total wisdom is in reach
The time has come to colour in the lines
We must identify the signs
So many people are full of hate
While love and light are in their reach
So many people will harm themselves
But life can be so beautiful
So many people will idolize
While their own success is in their reach

Turning out days to guide by
Each with its own display
Some with voltage spinning from the skytop
Some with light in a peaceful way

An appearance second to no other
Such a magnificent face
So broad and full of perspective
Known to everyone as

""Earth""! 
That little planet on the hill
Seems Earth could last forever
But for us it's not the same
The neglect to protect the creation

Leaves us little chance to remain
All in all it seems to go around in circles
Like the path followed by the moon
Enhanced by the human evolution

The wisdom of the

Human flesh instead of written letters
I rearrange my pathetic tissue
I incise, I replace, I'm reformed

I eradicate the fake, pre-present me
Elevate me to a higher human form
The characters I am
Made into a word complete then I'll be the new norm

Self inflicted fractures
I replace my bones with bars
Aluminum bleeding oxide
The drug of Gods into my pounding veins

My receiving eyes exchanged with fuses
Blindness induced to prevent destruction
Ceramic blades implanted
Past my ribs to save me from the dues of inhalation

I tear my worldly useless skin
Staples to pin it over my ears
Non-receptive of ungodly sounds
I disable the audio generators of fear

Hexagonal bolts to fill my mouth
Sharpened to deplete
The creator of all violence
Without speech there will be no deceit

Baptized in vitriolic acid
A final touch, a smoothing of features
Completion of the greatest art
To cast the godly creatures

Humans, once astray, made divine
Stripped of congenital flaws
We're incandescent
Revelations in a world of darkened forms

Disciples, come join with me
To save a failed humanity
Follow the God of cyanide
Into the new eternity

Behold a sacrificial erase
A cleansing worshiping of pain
The new millennium Christ
Here to redeem all from lies, lies"
Metal,"Drifting by the heavens unscarred. 
Yet unhealed before a bleeding cross. 
Thrown into the ash. 
Crumbling.

I've been crossed. 
Like the lies on a clocks face. 
I've been fed lies I can't comprehend. 
I've become but a mere seed again. 
And I'll prophesize the end. 
Now. 
I have yet begun to fight. 
There is no fear in my heart. 
No cause worthy of my respect. 
In the End I'll rot. 
I won't fall prey to deception. 
Deception is the means by which they profit. 
Deceit if their hearts. 
Evil within their souls. 
The cruelty by which they exploit will not be part of my life."
Metal,"Bearer of Sword
Stands beyond (the) Triumphant
As Eternal Night falls
On the Planet of (almost full) Void

Weaves War with a gesture of Might
Fallen are the Souls
Blinded by the Warrior Dreams
Finds the star invisible
To most of the regular Men and Slaves

and The Master serves Him

Leaves then for the Last Time
Finally His Castle
Monument of Misanthropy and Wrath
Hate
Loyal Friend of His Sober Hours
Treads on while the Faith Whips Sharp
Mental pain makes His Eyes Gleam
A light made of Dark Thrones and Frozen Winds
Now can leave the planet"

Metal,"No boundaries of what you've been through
Abused, molested
The pain you suffered from meaningless lunacy
Raped, penetrated, lunacy

Once innocent, now that is gone
Try to build your life from constant lies
Despise the one who bore you
Hate the one that made you
There's no one to confine to

The hate you feel inside
Rots away with the soul that died
Innocence is gone
Only limbs

Try to conquer your pain
Never daring to say no
For the fright of more pain to come
You let the act pass by
To be brutalized in the worst possible way

The hate you feel inside
Rots away with the soul that died
Innocence is gone
Only limbs

Shattered body and soul
Shattered body and soul
The plague will not withdraw
The hate you feel inside

The plague will come to haunt you down
Grind you down to nothing
The black light you see is all that you feel
Darkness, numbness fills the soul

The hate you feel inside - The hate you feel inside -
The hate you feel inside - The hate you feel inside

The hate you feel inside
Rots away with the soul that died
Innocence is gone
Only limbs exist in fearful hate

The hate you feel inside
Rots away with the soul that died
Innocence is gone
Only limbs"

So unreal, but I like it anyhow.

I can't live in a fairytale of lies.
And I can't hide from the feeling cause it's right.
And I go faster and faster and faster and faster for love.
And I can't live in a fairytale of lies.
I can feel that you've mesmerized my heart.
I feel so free.
I'm alive, I'm breaking out.
I won't give in, cause I'm proud of all my scars.
And I can see I've been wasting too much time.

The smell of blood has
filled this room
If I could do it all again
I would change most every single thing
I would let you
Kiss me
Kill me
Your kiss is torture
But killing me would be too easy
Our tragedy
Seems to be killing everything it sees
Like death itself
This valentine still looms
In the darkest hour, the killing moon
If I could do it all again
I would let you
Kiss me

Your kiss is torture
But killing me would be too easy
Kiss me (You're all I'm wanting)
Kill me (This feeling's haunting)
Your kiss is torture
But killing me would be too easy
Killing me would be too easy
Your eyes unwind the
tragedy of our lives
My eyes went blind
Believe when I say
Hell burns bright
When this night dies
Hell burns bright

Swallow the lives of harmless souls
Walking a crooked path their wicked names will rise.

The fire that burns inside!

That's makes them sacrifice!
That's driving them insane!
Trapped in this no man's land
Where angels dare to thread
Forever banned to the realms of the Never dead!
There is no one you can trust upon this grave
Die with those things with flu to sin
Feeding all the wars
They'll feed up in the end
If I fall I'll set the dark (Its right to be feeling wrong)

Swatting is no man's lair
Where angels dare to thread
Forever bet to the rounds of the Never Dead!

Imagine builds up in your body, you will be dying)
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE! IN THE REALMS OF THE NEVER DEAD!

Metal,"Remember the first dance we shared?
Recall the night you melted my ugliness away?
The night you left with a kiss so kind
Only a scent of beauty left behind
Ah dear friend I remember the night
The moon and the dreams we shared
Your trembling paw in my hand
Dreaming of that northern land
Touching me with a kiss of a beast
I know my dreams are made of you
Of you and only for you
Your ocean pulls me under
Your voice tears me asunder
Love me before the last petal falls
As a world without a glance
Of the ocean's fair expanse
Such the world would be
If no love did flow in thee
But as my heart is occupied
Your love for me now has to die
Forgive me I need more than you can offer me
Didn't you read the tale
Where happily ever after was to kiss a frog?
Don't you know this tale
In which all I ever wanted
I'll never have
For who could ever learn to love a beast?
However cold the wind and rain
I'll be there to ease your pain
However cruel the mirrors of sin
Remember beauty is found within
...Forever shall the wolf in me desire the sheep in
you...

Startle me, someone save me.

Fill my heart
They bury me

You were my step mom you always wanted me out of your sight.
I would come walkin' in and I'd say, ""Hello,""
but you'd slap me and make some fucked-up comment about my clothes.
But I tried to let it pass, but the visions in my head were with you with a knife up your ass laying dead.
So I popped some more caps in your ass.
Now your son is such a fuck -- motherfucking bitch
never try to play me!
You make my life -- not so....

Twilight keeps me here suspended, frozen still as time intended.

They try to keep me wide awake and I just want to give in .
I can't stop hearing these voices (they never end).
When will they let me fall asleep?
Wake up.

The night is clever, capable of deceiving weather.
Nothing always has a meaning, if everything is always breathing.
The body is my temple, a golden fragile vessel.
So sing me back to sleep, wrap me in your memory.
The floor boards speak, the curtains start to breathe.
Stuck in a lucid dream, wake from this treachery.

I can't stop hearing these voices (these voices in my head).
They try to keep me wide awake and I just want to give in.
I can't stop hearing these voices (they never end).
When will they let me fall asleep?
So let me sleep.

I can't stop hearing these voices (I can't stop). (I can't stop).

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

Your wings are broken

I still don't know
What could you have missed?
You had my love

Bring my heart to the place it's longing for
Show me the way to die as easy as I can

I think that I drowned

Tell 'em all I'm okay
So burn it down
Discover the dusk of your day
Has reached its dawn
So burn it down
Remember to find a new way
To carry on
Flew so high last night
I think that I fell
To the ground so heavy
Woke up to find this living hell
It used to be so easy
Hard to tell my nights
Now from my days
The curtains hide my feelings
Don't feel I have any right to pray
And will they find me someday
Someday
So burn it down
Discover the dusk of your day
Has reached its dawn
So burn it down
Remember to find a new way
To carry on
So burn it down
Discover the dusk of your day
Has reached its dawn
So burn it down
Remember to find a new way
To carry on
And whatever takes us away
Will be the same to drive us on
And whatever takes us away
Will be the same to drive us on
Remember to find a new way
A way to see it all
It's finally slipping away
Soon it will be gone
Remember to find a new day
Remember to carry on

I see the good in the bad and the ugly
I need the volume one louder than ten
I put the pedal to the metal, needle into the red
If the windows ain't shaking
Making my heart race
If I can't feel it in my chest
I'm in the wrong damn place!

I got a demon in my soul and a voice in my head
It's saying go, go, go! I can sleep when I'm dead
There's a sonic revelation bringing me to my knees
And there's a man down below who needs my sympathy
I got a ringing in my ears getting ready to burst
Screaming ""hallelujah, hallelujah take me to church""

I like it louder than the boom
Of a big bass drum
I need it harder than the sound
Of a guitar grunge
I love to crank it up
Make it thump
And evil to the core
Headbanging in the pit
And throwing my horns
And just like old school
Sabbath, Zeppelin and Lemmy
I need to drop it down low
And make it heavy
I like it heavy, oh ohh
I like it heavy, oh ohh

I ride the lightning, roll with the thunder
I'm going down down down with my sisters and brothers
I fell in love with their darkest parts
Stand on the side of the wild at heart
I plucked the feather off a crow so I could fly
Since I was thirteen years old I've had my fist to the sky

I like it louder than the boom

Buy a bottle of whiskey, we'll get matching tattoos
Tell me that you love me, oh let me drive your car
We can sit to morning light, just countin' every stars
'Cause if there's a Hell, I'll meet you there
And if there's a Heaven, they're serving beer
And if you're an angel then, I must be high
Oh if there's a church, it's rock 'n roll

Cannot run from the fury
You cannot run, you cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday, try to hide when you see me

Making you forget they're part of the scene

You wish you had nine to five instead of copying me
You do your soil work and yet you adore me
I said it in your face I'm your arch enemy
Stop what you're doing and run

You cannot run, you cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday, try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the fury
You cannot run, you cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday, try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the fury

Growl god
Growl god

I am your god, I am no saint, I need no fake it
I am the posters on your wall, that's why I set you free
Who is Elize? I have no clue 'cause all I see is me
Make me forget that I am a part of a team

I understand that you are hating my philosophy
The guys behind me ain't no band, they're slaving, slaving, slaving for me
I cannot fake it, fake it, cannot fake it anymore
The fury, the growl god, I roar

You cannot run, you cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday, try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the fury
You cannot run, you cannot hide or fly away
Escape from yesterday, try to hide when you see me
Cannot run from the fury"
Metal,"Recruiting the ill-fated for ""The War""
A legion of uneducated ,bankrupt souls
With a lust for revenge,answering the call
From New Yorqatar to Califarabia
Desperation provides fettile ground for religious extremism
This glorious brainwashing where prejudice lies
Like a crouching tiger
Tormenting peasants till they erect an army
Under everyone's nose
In the end propaganda destroys their DNA,God help them
Solo-Drover
Solo-Mustaine
All that they envisioned of what things would come to be
Turned into a pink mist when they blew to smithereens
We are just a war away from Amerikhastan
When God versus God;the undoing of man
Promising a vapor,in the end they become one
Solo-Drover
No rules of engagement,this enemy hides
Amongst women and children
And to beat violence,you must ignore the focus groups
You must send in the Mossad, turn of the BBC,CNN
And don't look back
Rest assured there'll be no more Middle Eastern crisis,hell!
There'll be no more Middle East!
These are your people Lady Liberty
Pull up your dress today
And tattooed is ""property of The USA
A subsidiary of Halliburton""
Surprise?!
But a roaring lion is about to be unleashed on earth
Hey,Jihad Joe?Guess what?We're coming to get you!

Metal,"Silent places after rain 
Monuments fall the last strike of fate 
End time ravens over blood oceans flames 

Spread the ancient plague 
Among the wolves of wrath 

As the last sad existence enters the grave 
Battle torn the angels cry with not a soul to save 
Let us close our eyes and dream of the plague 

Spread the ancient plague 
Among the wolves of wrath 

Purify the earth from all it's worms 
Dissolving into the void through the thunder and the storms 
Let us close out eyes and dream of the plague 

Patriots and Warfare 
Demonstrating arrogance 
Superior armys waiting for their final call to arms 
Winds of mayhem choirs for the final pestilence 
A gospel rapture battlecry of barbarians 

Death to all the empires 
Death to lifelong wars 
Death to bitter sons of the antichrist 
Death to the World 

Silent places after the rain 
Monuments fall the last strike of fate 
End time ravens over blood oceans flames 

And I saw millions of souls 
Preparing for the last incarnation 
No more earthly pleasures no more life's temptation 
And the ghosts of long forgotten sociates 
Cast out wicked dreams from the heart of the lost 
The future is drowning in the ashes of the past 
And through the toxic stench of human tragedy 
A savious apears in a red mask in front of me 
AND SATAN IS HIS NAME!!!"

My apology's enough, but it's all in your head.

All will be for love you know. My dear, you know, patience
And in time, all will be clear.
And the truth is, I couldn't love you more than I have come to know.
And this Mother Sun is proud to have watched you grow.
You are the perceiver, that perceived the parable, the never ending end.
You are the infinite (Intuit), you are the finite (Fire).
You are, you are, you are, you are

""In other words, the so-called involuntary
Circulation of your blood is one continuous process with the stars shining. 
If you find out it's you! 
Who circulates your blood, 
You will at the same moment find out that you are shining the sun.
Because your physical organism is one continuous process with
Everything else that's going on. 
Just as the waves are continuous with the ocean. 
Your body is continuous with the total energy system
Of the cosmos, and it's all you. 
Only you're playing the game that you're only this bit of it"""
Metal,"The war is over
The crypt we now taste
In the late 1900's, there is no human race
We split the planet with atomic birth
Man has died
We seal the urn.

Negotiations are over
Troops are marching to their doom
All that I see is a nightmare
The smoke is blotting out the moon
No, God please stop this bloody slaughter
We are off the beaten track
All the masses are rebelling
To withstand the dark attack
Will we make it back beyond the black?

Tanks are rolling in millions
See them come, and now they're gone
All the mountains are blackened
They said it came from just one bomb
No God please stop this bloody slaughter
Let it all repeat -- attack
All the masses are rebelling
To withstand the dark attack
Will we make it back beyond the black?
Will we make it back beyond?

Out of the crypt with faces marred
Seems the night has won
We unite as one
No more weapons, no more guns
Look out!
Food supplies are worth more than gold
Turn the young into old
With blinded eyes we count the cost
Of everything that we lost
Look out!

Watch out!
Beyond the black!"

Rich girl, wannabe,
Bought a quick pick for the lottery.
Watching TV with her boyfriend,
Fell asleep, left the ticket on the nightstand.
He stayed awake to see the ball drop,
Turned it way down, she never woke up.
Grabbed the keys to her car and the back lock,
Threw a shot of Jack back, left with the jackpot.

Go to hell.

Starts to shake
A rift opens up, I take

What the future holds in store

A day will come
When the sun will rise again
Rays of black will shine
And together as one,
We will walk in the dark of the sun

Say a prayer for the unborn child in the womb
The children are the heirs of this dogmatic chaos
Is there a future in this claustrophobic tomb?

Prepared to fight for our promised land

They’d dearly make us pay
For laughing in their faces and
Making it our way there’s

There’s dust want to steal us all and
Take us all apart
But not in
So swallow all your tears my love
And put on your new face
You can never win or lose if

But is as valuable as life

With sorrow as the ring

I still breath when the loss reminds me again
I am here

Life is fear and sorrow's all I know
Am I in dept cause so it seems
But what I owe
I don't know

Devoured by guilt and cursed beyond control
My every morning is in every way
The beginning of a recreation day"
Metal,"In the distance from far away
I can hear your voice, the words that you say
You left forever, your love has been gone
But I still feel so strong... for you

You left me crying, you're leaving me alone
You and I together, once it was so strong
The shield of love has broken, you're fire has been gone
Now I'm back on my own

Come back and stay
Don't leave me all alone
Can you hear me pray
Forever
Forever

I want you,
All the rest of my life
I want you,
All the rest of my life
(The) rest of my life

Every moment (still) I'm thinking of you
But it seems that there's nothing, nothing I can do
If there's something, something I could say
To bring you back some day

Come back and stay
Don't leave me all alone
Can you hear me pray
Forever
Forever

I want you,
All the rest of my life
I want you,
All the rest of my life
(The) rest of my life

I want you,
All the rest of my life
I want you,
'Cause I need you
All the rest of my life

I want you,
And I want you
All the rest of my life
I want you,
(You'll always be the one)
All the rest of my life
(The rest of my life)

I want you,
(I need you close to me)
All the rest of my life
I want you,
('Cause I need you)
All the rest of my life
(All the rest of my life)

Yeah"
Metal,"o
ye whose future is in other hands!
foul feeders! slipped
are ye on you excrement?
parasites! having the world lousy
imagine ye are of significance to heaven
i
who enjoy my body
would rather pack with wolves
than enter your pest - houses
sensation. nutrition. mastication. procreation.!
this is your blind - worm cycle
know ye of nothing further than your own stench?
heaven is indifferent to your salvation or catastrophe
the sword - trust - not salve - i bring!
honest was sodom!
your theology is a slime - pit of gibberish become ethics
in your world
where ignorance and deceit constitute felicity
everything ends miserably -
- besmirched with fratricidal blood."
Metal,"Harbringer of death and slaughter
(Next time round you'll be the slain)
Refuse the dying man your water
(Thirst when you come back again).
Don't spare the rod don't spoil the child
(I hope you like to take a beating)
Feed your face while others starve
(You'd better learn to not miss eating.)

Shining beaty fair and wise,
Has served it's time as dim an sallow
An honest judge seeks truth through eyes
Which once gazed lifeless from the gallows.
Hands that heal the sick and lame,
Long since held tools of inquisition.
Tongues which speak words true and sane
Have chanted sermons on perdition.

[Chorus]
Cross the bridge that spans forever
Living thread of evermore.
Without beginning ending never,
Living thread of evermore
See the footprints in the sand
Countless lifetimes gone before,
Point our path with unseen hands
The living thread of evermore.

From egg and sperm 'neath sticky sheet,
To ash and bone or maggot meat,
The way looks neither pleasant or too long
So have you stopped to wonder whether
If when weighted against a feather,
All your deeds appear so big and strong?

Cross the bridge that spans forever
Living thread of evermore.
Without beginning ending never,
Living thread of evermore
See the footprints in the sand
Countless lifetimes gone before,
Point our path with unseen hands
The living thread of evermore.

Light and dark complete the circle
Find the yang to fit the Yin
Barren desert lush green myrtle
Chase the wind to lift your wing

From egg and sperm 'neath sticky sheet,
To ash and bone or maggot meat,
The way looks neither pleasant or too long
So have you stopped to wonder whether
If when weighted against a feather,
All your deeds appear so big and strong?

Cross the bridge that spans forever
Living thread of evermore.
Without beginning ending never,
Living thread of evermore"
Metal,"From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture's there
The memory won't escape me
[Mike]
We're stuck in a place so dark you can hardly see
The manner of matter that splits with the words I breathe
And as the rain drips acidic questions around me
I block out the sight of the powers that be
And duck away into the darkness, times up
I wind up in a rusted world with eyes shut
So tight that it blurs into the world of pretend
And the eyes easy open and it's dark again
From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture's there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care
[Chali 2NA]
In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
[Mike]
Listen to the sound, dizzy from the ups and downs
I'm nauseated by the polluted rock that's all around
Watching the wheels of cars
that pass I look past
To the last of the light and the long shadows it casts
A window grows and captures the eye
And cries out a yellow light as it passes me by
And a young shadowy figure sits in front of a box
Inside a building of rock with antennas on top
Now, nothing can stop in this land of the pain
The sane lose not knowing they were part of the game
And while the insides change the box stays the same
And the figure inside could bear anybody's name
The memories I keep are from a time like then
I put on my paper so I could come back to them
Someday I'm hoping to close my eyes and pretend
That this crumpled up paper can be perfect again
[Mike And Chali 2NA]
From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture's there
The memory won't escape me
[Chali 2NA]
I'm here at this podium talking, the ceremonial offerings
Dedicated to urban dysfunctional offspring
(What's happening?)
City governments are eternally napping
Trapped in greedy convenants
causing an urban collapsing
Bullets that scar souls with dark holds
Get more then your car stole,
some hearts be blacker than charcoal
(For real) This society's deprivation depends
Not on our differences but the separation within
No preparation is made, limited aid, and minimum wage
Living in a tenement cage for innocent pay
Tragedy within a parade
The darkness overspreads like a permanent plague
In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up.."
Metal,"I know it's true that you're feeling oppressed
I know that some hold you down
But fighting evil with still more evil
Is not the way it's done

[Chorus]
We run in circles inside our minds
With no way out or in
If we're not careful they'll get our souls
We musn't let them win

We're fighting evil...
The hands of darkness, they reach out for you
It's not a game we play
Madmen telling, but you don't listen
To a single word they say

[Chorus]

We're fighting evil...
They're blinding your eyes, telling you lies
To bring disorder to the world
But don't you give in
We've got to show them together we can be strong

[Chorus]

We're fighting evil..."
Metal,"Fighting and biting, white thunder and lightning
Chasing the locust on its trail
Movements of Majyk, false moves become tragic
According to winds, how we sail

Flight of the Hydra
Flight of the Hydra

Snare of the pharaoh, remember now they know
Or knew of the universe vast
Sign of the symbol finds passageways nimble
Revealing the old Satanas

Flight of the Hydra
Flight of the Hydra

Flight of the night, flight of the soul
Flight of your life, spirit of gold, fly

Searching and searing, sarcastically feeding
Deceiving the truth from the next
Enchantment embraces the snake as it ages
Awaiting the life that is next

Flight of the Hydra
Flight of the Hydra

Metal,"Fight for the black shark
See what evil brings
Can't you see we're out for blood
Love from a shotgun
License to kill
Can't you see we're out for blood

Loving energy bite with delight
And we blow out our minds with your truth
And together we stand for the youth

Red Hot, Red Hot
To the top, we are
Red Hot

Shout at the Devil
We've laughed at your wars
Can't you see we're out for blood
Run with the pack, now
Always ask for more
Can't you see we're out for blood

Love would all save us

Look what love gave us
A world full of killing
And blood spilling
That world never came
And they say
That a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as we all fly away
Now that the world isn't ending
It's love that I'm sending to you
It isn't the love of a hero

Metal,"Got a god and herbless. I want everything she offers and won't settle for less. I see heaven under my feet as well as over my head. Bet you wish you was already dead. Always less done than said. Met this guy, who knows why. But he says, ""I know where you'll go when you die"". Told him how I felt for his god and that I wasn't impressed. You see, I'm already blessed. I want to ride. Gun in my hand. God on my side. I've tride. So far no good. More than a little misunderstood. Love the fall. No control.

I am the evil one
No glory to be reached
No more thy slavery

Smash thy will
Ye pale dominion fades away my
Will dominates

And watch my star arise
Burning up the earth
Sun, the eye of gods
Threw into the space
Watch ye moon eclipse
Falling from thy grace
Watch all nations cry
All feared of his name
Praise the flame!
Watch angels falling from the skies
Praise the flame!
I killed thy god
My will is done!
Thou art lord

Rise me! rise me high!
Lead through the gates of sun
Rise me! rise me high!
Where angels do not dare to fly
Invite to feast of gods
And let me drift away
Leave flames of infamy
And watch me kiss the stars"
Metal,"Please let me help you bury your dead
They've made the incision and driven their industry's waste in your head

The pyres in the distance glow beyond the haze
The hypocrites bear witness to the end of days
This is your final warning, a war on freewill is coming

This disillusion, this ignorant display
Defies solution and emasculates disdain

The sheep march to the fire and wait to host the flies
Their greedy little maggots clean the wounds with pride
This is your final warning, a war on freewill is coming

They feast on the meat in bittersweet denial
And swallow the blood of poisoned truths
They pick at the meat, a bittersweet feast for all the liars

In idle servitude the worker pig so sad
The lizards in wither have risen to censor the thoughts in your head

The sheep are stoned and quiet choking on the lies
The lizards feed the fire without compromise
This is your final warning, a war on freewill is coming

They feast on the meat in bittersweet denial
And swallow the blood of poisoned truths
They pick at the meat, their bittersweet feast

Begging forgiveness in denial, your misery shows it's face
You drown in your weakness, the plasphemous river washes away your mistakes

Solo 1: Smyth, Solo 2: Loomis

Please let me help you bury your dead
They've made the incision and driven their industry's waste in your head

This is your final warning, the holocaust of thought is dawning

And swallow the blood of poisoned truths
They pick at the meat, their bittersweet feast
A bittersweet feast for all the liars"

But tonight, tonight, it's on tonight
I don't want your boring life
And I don't want your 9 to 5

To get a real job and get back in line
You can say I'll never be a millionaire
Tell me this guitar won't get me anywhere
I got responsibility...
That is my liability...
I'm questioning authority...
They say there's not a chance for me

As you lure me I know the truth

Tell me where will you be?
When it's over

Tell me where will you hide?
When it's over

Do they simply seem to have a mind of their own?

Everyone sees who you really are
When your castle crumbles at your feet
Don't you run to me
When it's over...
And all this pride you hold inside is dying...

Time and place are set
Admission is free if you want to see

For the main event
They show their faces, take their places
Raging with contempt

Lights go down, smoke all around
Contenders eye each other
The challenge is made who'll make the grade
The ref pulls down the covers

At the centre of the ring they sway and swing
Exchanging fancy holds
When one's done they tag another one
How far will she go

Tag team baby - a camel clutch
Tag team baby - you are too much
Tag team baby - a scissor lock
Tag team baby - just want to rock

On the ropes you're losing hope
In a hold we'll put you out cold
Got your back pinned down on the mat
Looks like we're the winners tonight

In round seven she's in heaven
How much can she take
Again and again she feels the strain
As she start the eighth

The bell is hit the stage is lit
She staggers to the centre
Opponents meet their body's heat
The boys tonight have spent her

She's going down she's on the ground
You can hear her howl
She can't take no more 'cause she's so sore
She's throwing in the towel
Ha, ha throwin in her towel

Gave your best but you lost the test
Didn't you know a way to win

Tag team baby - down for the count
Tag team baby - you lost the bout
Tag team baby - oh what a catch
Tag team baby - you blew the match"

Tied to my past

Always said a prayer for me

I'm drifting in time
No reason I find
You always come to my soul
Somehow you believed
There'd always be a season for us to behold
I'm drifting in time
No reason no rhyme
You always come to my soul
I've learned to believe
So thank you for the slow burn you'be brought to my heart
And you are the one
Yes you are the one

I have been too distant
Sometimes just too far away
Let me go and leave it all behind
Sorry if I've hurt you
Sorry for the time we've lost
If you could just forgive me
I'd bow down before you
So that you could see I'm real
So that you could hear these words

I'm drifting in time
No reason I find

Somehow you believed
There'd always be a season for us to behold
I'm drifting in time
No reason no rhyme
You always come to my soul

Hands pressed on the walls
I've got sand filling to the neck
How much longer can I fall?

Every day becomes another waste
I'll never find my way
I'm numb to the taste

Do you remember all the days when you still knew my face
Oh God, what I'd give to, to go back to that place
Here we stand separated
You're better off alone
Can't go back to the places
I'm looking back just like a ghost
How did you slip away so far, so fast
Can I break this hourglass? Can I break this?

I've got a sickness that I can't seem to shake
And I know that you hold the cure
One choice remains

Every grain is another day
Every day becomes another waste
Maybe I'll never find my way
I'm numb to the taste

Do you remember all the days when you still knew my face
Oh God, what I'd give to, to go back to that place
Here we stand separated
You're better off alone
Can't go back to the places
I'm looking back just like a ghost
How did you slip away so far, so fast
Can I break this hourglass? Can I break this?

Please help me, me empty the hourglass
Give me more time
And I swear I'll find a way back to the body, to the body that was mine

Please help me, me empty the hourglass
Give me more time
And I swear I'll find a way back to the body, to the body that was mine

Metal,"Nem tudo está tão bem
Não posso enganar você

posso sorrir e te ver feliz
como posso sorrir e mentir pra mim
Mesmo sofrendo
Com meus mil defeitos
Tenho que me manter feliz
Você não tem culpa
Do meu sofrimento
Não pense assim, eu sei o que fazer
Posso sorrir e te ver feliz

I can't tell you why I'm breaking down.
Do you wonder why I prefer to be alone?
Have I really lost control?

I can't sleep so I take a breath
And hide behind my bravest mask,
I admit I've lost control."

Buried deep within
My veins are like the deepest roots,
My darkest sins

A castle I have built
It's walls have just begun to crack,
I am full of guilt
Over and over the nightmare never ends
I have been ripped, I have been torn
Over and under, to hell and back again
The demon deep inside re-born
The time has come for me to conquer
everlasting rage
To free me from my suffering,
Break me from my cage

I have seached deep within
down in my soul
I have found myself, myself,
I have found

A restitution for my sins
This castle I've re-built
The walls are now un-shakeable
I am free of guilt"

Mastermind, please, 
Would you do away with me too?"
Metal,"Can you hear the whispering wind
Over the screams of your dying friends?
Did you know your life is mine?

[Chorus:]
You know what I got
Ham on the bone
A little thing I just can't leave alone
Now I feel the purpose of my life defined
Ham on the bone is mine

Now you are called
To the desperate scene at the throbbing ball
And you'll do it all, now you've become my geni-thrall

[Chorus]
Ham on ham, ham on the ham on the ham on [Repeat x5]
Now my hand grasp my throbbing root and shan't unclasp
Go to the head of the class as I madly stoke my flaccid shaft

[Chorus]

Ham ham ham ham, ham on the bone [Repeat x4]"
Metal,"My life was brought into a nightmare, dark shadows surrounded me
Five times the pain of torture is buried deep within me
It makes me shiver down my spine to even think of it

Talk to me, what is the reason
I'm finished, answer me
Completely blinded by agony

Save me from my tears

Save me, falling down, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)
Save me, frozen inside, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)

I'm going insane, it feels like I am lost, the panic, the fear
The mind tricks are haunting me, is this my destiny

Talk to me, what is the reason
I'm finished, answer me
Completely blinded by agony

Save me from my tears

Save me, falling down, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)
Save me, frozen inside, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)

Leaving all tears behind (angels of clarity, show me the way)
Leaving my past behind (I'm about to fade away, show me the way, angels of
Clarity)

Save me from my tears

Save me, falling down, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)
Save me, frozen inside, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)

Save me, falling down, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)
Save me, frozen inside, angels of clarity (I am dead by anxiety)"
Metal,"Once there were beautiful trees
Now there are concrete seas
An eerie calm has befallen the land
Cacophony of wonderful sounds
Is replaced by a symphony of silence
Fading letters of comforting words
She never had time to say goodbye

When there were beautiful trees
She's been alone
She's been alone for some time, now
It's been a while
Quite a while
A miracle has befallen her land
Cacophony of wonderful sounds
Is replaced by silence
She had it all
What's left is there to fall
She had it all
What's left is there to call"
Metal,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, out
Everyone is waiting for the light

One
Here comes the sun
Two
Here comes the sun
Three
It is the brightest star of them all

Metal,"Sacrifice won't suffice
Resurrection needs your death
To happen twice
Fall on my heart
And burn and forge
Your tortured black-smitten
Into the sharpest, fucking sword
Don't assume that I'm always with you
It's just where my mortal body happens to be
No sineater to slay
Us children of cain
Watching monkey suicide
Sunday aids and church wine wash it away
Christ consciousness
Manifest to the golden ratio
5 or 500 year ago
We were 15 foot high
And to die
Was a bardot bridge(t)
We never thought we'd cross
To burn down behind and below
No sineater to slay
Us children of cain
Watching monkey suicide
Sunday aids and church wine wash it away
Don't assume that I'm always with you
It's just where my mortal body happens to be
So take your little black book
I see the way that you look in to it
I'll eat it and I'll cut my tongue
And all the pages you spread,
Sweet as honey you said
But I'm choking on your bitter stories
No sineater to slay
Us children of cain
Watching monkey suicide
Sunday aids and church wine wash it away
Sunday aids and church wine wash it away"

As we make our way to heaven
Through the Nazi lines

We've been training for years
Now we're ready to strike
As the great operation begins
We're the first wave on the shore
We're the first ones to fall
Yet soldiers have fallen before

In the dawn they will pay
With their lives as the price
History's written today
In this burning inferno
Know that nothing remains
As our forces advance on the beach

Aiming for heaven though serving in hell
Victory is ours their forces will fall

Through the gates of hell
As we make our way to heaven
Through the Nazi lines
Primo victoria

On the 6th of June
On the shores of western Europe 1944
D-day upon us

We've been here before
Used to this kind of war
Crossfire grind through the sand
Our orders were easy
It's kill or be killed
Blood on both sides will be spilled

In the dawn they will pay
With their lives as the price
History's written today
Now that we are at war
With the axis again
This time we know what will come

Aiming for heaven though serving in hell
Victory is ours their forces will fall

Through the gates of hell
As we make our way to heaven
Through the Nazi lines
Primo victoria

On 6th of June
On the shores of western Europe 1944
D-day upon us

6th of June 1944
Allies are turning the war
Normandy state of anarchy
Overlord

Victory is ours their forces will fall

Metal,"Shifting through the ashes
And scratching through my life
And how sick is it to live with the promises
No rhyme or reason expect another fight
And my decisions are based on your ignorance

And I blame you
For everything you do
For all the scars I bare
And breathing all my air
For everything I'll ever do
I blame you

I'm taking every prisoner through the ups and downs
And my ship ain't gonna sink to the hypocrites
Reach deep inside me and tear away my soul
And nobody left to comfort me anymore

And I blame you
For everything you do
For all the scars I bare
And breathing all my air
For everything I'll ever do
I blame you

And I blame you

For all the scars I bare

Metal,"Goodbye, I'll mend your loss. Your ashes and embers will soon light up the skies. The carcass of your martyr burns, in the process of punishment. You only have yourself to blame, so take my hands, for you will be burned before their eyes. What more does it take to see your death? How much must be done to see you choke. Let the carcass of the martyr burn in the process of punishment. Suspended by the throat, the knot chokes

Come paw the skin, come slay the harvest.
Come lick the sky, come reach the heavens.
Each grain of flesh, each drop of pleasures.

The dustcloud of our lust,
Redeemed in hate.
Deoderize our claws of rot.
Wash them clean of taste.

And we swarm towards the sun or the creedence of it.
And we whip the sky for blessings or for the joy of it."
Metal,"Today I walked down our old street
Past the diner where we'd meet
Now I dine alone in our old seats
The cold wind blows right through my bones
And I feel like I'm getting old
But I wish I was getting old with you
I held your hand when we took shelter from the rain
She laughed as we picked out our children's names

White sparrows fell from heaven and carried her away
Black arrows cut the strings of my heart, I kneel and pray

Her clothes hang in the closet still
The phone sits on the windowsill
And every time it rings it gives me chills
My heart just stopped when I was told
Doctor, doctor, on the phone
Said my love was never coming home
I hold your casket gently walking to the grave
Dark clouds eclipse the sun won't shine again

White sparrows fell from heaven and carried her away
Black arrows cut the strings of my heart, I kneel and pray

They gave her one more day
To say the words I couldn't say
I'm crying in pain, crying in pain

And I'm not looking for answers
No, I'm not looking for answers
But dear God, why did you choose her?

White sparrows fell from heaven and carried her away
Black arrows cut the strings of my heart, I kneel and pray

They gave her one more day
To say the words I couldn't say
I'm crying in pain (crying in pain)
Crying in pain
Our love will remain
I'm crying in pain"

Metal,"From the south they came
In battle for the king of Spain
In the lowlands hell
After the iconoclast
Heretics rage unbound
Against the church

The duke of Alva, coming from Spain
Fought our country with an iron will
Raised the blood council the devil's way

Their army came so strong
To control this land they thought
They forgot the sea
Then the buccaneers they came
To fight arch enemy Spain
Reclaim our land

This war would last for 80 years
The prince of Nassau, lead this rebel land
Victory, the enemies defeat
Win the war against arch enemy Spain

The king of spain, sick and tired of this game
Hired an assassin, Balthazar
This rebel leader had to be taken away
To become the assassins prey, Balthazar

The duke of Alva, coming from Spain
Lost this country against his masters will
Retreated his armies or what was left

Then the assassin came to kill our prince for Spain
Shot in the head
From the south they came
In battle for the king of Spain
In the lowlands hell

Balthazar, Balthazar, I forgive you"
Metal,"Want to tell ya a story that happened to me
There was this old man started chattin' with me
He sat by himself on the side of the road
A cowboy hat and them pointed toes
He said, hey son what do ya do
Ya better pay attention when I'm talkin' to you
I've been around here for a long, long time
Could have bought this land for damn near a dime
(Right over there past that gas station over there, see it)
So I headed on over, leaned against his truck
And ya better hear me out or you're shit outta luck
I've been through times that you wouldn't believe
It makes a man feel about a hundred and three
Again he asked, what do ya do
I can't imagine by lookin' at you
Boy, things have changed since way back when
I wish that I was back in my teens again
I said hey, I said hey, to what the old man said
So we hopped in his truck, went for a ride
He talked about things before I was alive
Ya know, that used to be a big mining town
My brother and I brought that mountain down
My oh my, look how they built over there
Have ya ever thought about cutting that hair
Ya never told me what do ya do
Tell me kid, are ya just passing through
You say hey, you say hey, from what the old man said
So I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried
Yeah, I tried to speak my piece
So, low and behold when all was told the only listening one was me
So I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried
Yeah, I tried to break on through
So, low and behold when all was told the stubburn one was he
So the moral of the story is ya gotta learn a lesson
Especially from a man who got a Smith and Wesson
Ya better learn with your ears and not with your eyes
Or you'll be dealt a big surprise
I said hey, I said hey
To what the old man said
>From what he said now"

Now I see you takin advantage,
And I found another reason to do this.
I'm diggin us a hole to travel through,
I wanna find a way to rattle you,
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit,
You're gonna have to follow me under it.
Let go, it's begun,
Close your eyes, I'm not done,
Breathe a word, and waste your breath,
And keep it up till there's nothing left.

Just as the darkness turned to light,
Just as the next light turns to day,
And the world gets underway,
All I can see is the anticipation,
Waiting to take this out on the wind and the raindrops,
And I waited patiently taking it in,
Ready for the first of the face offs.
I'm diggin us a hole to travel through,
I wanna find a way to rattle you,
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit,
You're gonna have to follow me under it.

You wanna try to hear the thunder hit,
You're gonna have to follow me under it.

I'm diggin us a hole to travel through,
I wanna find a way to rattle you,
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit,
You're gonna have to follow me under it.
Let go, it's begun,
Close your eyes, I'm not done,
Breathe a word, and waste your breath,
And keep it up till there's nothing left.
No!"
Metal,"You've got your
Hell's teeth
Smiling at you.
It keeps your brain safe,
As it all eats at your face...
And don't worry,
We'll 'blur it out'
And no one
Ever will know,
Oh
No, oh oh oh
This is my beautiful show
And everything is shot
In slo-motion
This is my beautiful show
And everything is shot
In slo-motion
Slo-mo-tion
Pump in the laughter
Of dead-audience applause
And teenage rape candidates
I think we got ourselves
A 'real hit'
Don't we wish
That we had something
More than
Hate amber panic
And panic
Morbid panic
Hate and morbid panic
This is my beautiful show
And everything is shot
In slo-motion
This is my beautiful show
And everything is shot
In slo-motion
Slo-mo-tion
I'm the host with vaseline
I hide behind bulletproof glass
And I can feel your tits
With my brand new camera
(equipped with a flash)
Fast-food-nude
I hate you all
But somehow
You find me...
Incredibly charming
This is my beautiful show
And everything is shot
In slo-motion
(incredibly charming)
This is my beautiful show
And everything is shot
In slo-motion
Slo-mo-tion
(incredibly charming)
Slo-mo-tion

This is my beautiful show
And everything is shot

Metal,"What doesn't kill you makes you wish you were dead
Got a hole in my soul, growing deeper and deeper
And I can't take one more moment of this silence
The loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up
It comes in waves, I close my eyes
Hold my breath and let it bury me
I'm not okay, and it's not alright
Won't you drag the lake and bring me home again?
Who will fix me now?
Dive in when I'm down?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown
Who will make me fight? Drag me out alive?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown
What doesn't destroy you, leaves you broken instead
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper
And I can't take one more moment of this silence
The loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up
It comes in waves, I close my eyes
Hold my breath and let it bury me
I'm not okay, and it's not alright
Won't you drag the lake and bring me home again?
Who will fix me now?
Dive in when I'm down?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown
Who will make me fight? Drag me out alive?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown
'Cause you know that I can't do this on my own
(Woah oh oh oh)
'Cause you know that I can't do this on my own
(Woah oh oh oh)
'Cause you know that I can't do this on my own
(Woah oh oh oh)
('Cause you know that I can't do this on my own.)
Who will fix me now?
Who will fix me now?
Who will fix me now?
Dive in when I'm down?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown"
Metal,"In this secret way
He knew you first

And from those lips, a seed

Your mouth dropped open
Darkness fell out

Kept close in skin
Kept close in blood
And in he was

And from those lips, a seed

This is the gift that he received
Twisted roots kept warm

Rape she was and ready for the death"
Metal,"yeah
i think i've said enough
but i'm not thinking anymore
adrenaline has pumped me up
and i can't even see the floor
my vision's blurred and i'm screaming
down in a hole
i think i'm losing control
of all the voices screaming out in my head
so far gone
feel like it's been so damn long
since i could shut my fucking mouth instead
i got no control
you're just a little more
but it's more than i need
a self-afflicted wound
this time the knife has cut too deep
i'm on the floor and i'm bleeding
down in a hole
i think i'm losing control
of all the voices screaming out in my head
so far gone
feel like it's been so damn long
since i could shut my fucking mouth instead
i got no control
down in a hole
i think i'm losing control
of all the voices screaming out in my head
so far gone
feel like it's been so damn long
since i could shut my fucking mouth instead
i got no control,"
Metal,"I process
You're a constant changing phases
I watch them
Releasing right on cue…
In time, in sync
Tonight the stage is yours
So why wait to discover your dreams?
Now here's your chance
I promise
To watch and raise your babies
In time, in sync
Tonight the stage is yours
I'm hypnotized by your name
I wish this night would never end
So why wait for the colors to bleed?
What do you expect?
So heartless we march into the fumes
In time, in sync
Tonight the stage is yours
I'm hypnotized by your name
I wish this night would never end
I wish this night"
Metal,"You're calling me late at night Spasmodically breathing You wisper to my tired ear unintelligible message Sloooooow!!! Stone it, fuck it! Don't creep like a pig You read me your last will while you're sleeping Your gabble maybe is charming me But can't you see - you're drowning I tell you, you must go to bed I don't know, what I know And I don't call a medicine man I should know that you drown"
Metal,"Writing and embraced
Retribution. Soul eclipse turns solid
Energized. Sucking vomit acting like its honey
Deprived of I
Falling while thrusting squares through circles
Serving one single new dimension

Terror rising. Agnostics nemesis. A prophet of extinction

I scorch the skies before your very eyes
My deliverance - enslavement labelled: love

Just trust this nemesis to sign and seal extinction"
Metal,"GO!
The first thing that you feel is a rumblin'
The next thing you know everything starts crumblin'
Stumbling and you're trying to escape
So you want to get away from your faith
but you can't but wait!
OH no ain't no discounts
you never want it all yall want the full amount
of the lyrical gumbo not mumbo
when it's stronger then a coffee jumbo
the black buffallo from the GTS
came from my back
and the T on my chest
am I up to the test? aw yes
with my brand new style
so fresh
some folks trying to say I'm old off
showed off
got with my boys and road off
to provide the dust
and tumbleweeds
make way for the buffalo stampede
Runnin' free
the Buffalo is here
safe in bed while my country hits me
want to go out
like a horse and a breakness
Runnin' free
the Buffalo is here
safe in bed while my country hits me
want to go out
like a horse and a breakness
The whole world can change
in the blink of an eye
try not to cry
feel the pain and the pride
and the loneliness
and the phonyness
all I want is the truth
can you show me this?
but you're here to hook beats
your pace quickens
and you're clucking around like chickens
the Buffallo is on a roll
now you know
like I said popo
so tell your momma and them
save your drama for them
tell all your kin folks
your cousins and your friends
and get on over to the Ponderosa
and move your body and your boody
like you know you're supposedta
some folks trying to say I'm old off
showed off
got with my boys and road off
to provide the dust
and tumbleweeds
make way for the buffalo stampede
Runnin' free
the Buffalo is here
safe in bed while my country hits me
want to go out
like a horse and a breakness
Runnin' free
the Buffalo is here
safe in bed while my country hits me
want to go out
like a horse and a breakness
(music break)
one, two, three, four
From Little Big Horn to wounded knee
The trailer kids you'll never find me
and like a cheese boy
you know I'm outlasting
You know I got a hell of a ton of um asking
Runnin' free
the Buffalo is here
safe in bed while my country hits me
want to go out
like a horse and a breakness
Runnin' free
the Buffalo is here
safe in bed while my country hits me
want to go out

YEEAAAAAAAAA!"
Metal,"My passions rise
A twilight ride
Stark light of dark night in my eyes

My forlorn lust
My soul it burns
My forlorn lust

My soul is burning
Take you now, in my sleep
I want to touch you, to scratch you deep

To leave you scarred
To see you burn
To leave you scarred
To see you burning"
Metal,"There was no warning, no sign of danger
We saw smoke in the sky and fear in their eyes
We felt that something terrible'ld come
Saw a field of fire, we're under the gun

We could not believe
And pursued the scenery

Fire on the horizon
Fire on the horizon

We were encircled by machines never seen
Death on the horizon, they came out of the dawn
All forces in trouble, the nuclear weapons
Were everywhere seen, the state of emergency

Faith at the front
The invaders from beyond

Fire on the horizon
Fire on the horizon"
Metal,"Hate is a killer in breeding frenzy 
Growing faster becoming deadly. 
Wake up, together. see'mon fight the beast: 
Tyrant control in the Middle East
Poison, power. Driven by fury 
Digital dictator, blackened expropriator 
Deliver us from evil. Save the people 
Contagion of hatred must be eliminated
Savior, 
Save us from anger 
Put to the test 
Will we ever know?
The hunter, an animal without emotion. 
Mechanical destruction, methodical corruption 
Wake up, can't you see, the peace and harmony 
Is there if you want it
Savior, 
Save us from anger 
Put to the test 
Will we ever know?"
Metal,"Go!

Sick, am I sick?
And for these last five years
I've been stuck up in here
Inside this brain that drains into society
Inject it in your veins

Give me hand grenades
Give me razor blades
Give me anything to make the pain go away
'Cause these pills don't work
Sometimes they make it worse
And now I'm slowly going down the fucking drain

The lights are on
But there's no one home
And I sit here in my dark place alone
Dark place alone

I, I don't mind the side effects of my so-called life
Now I bide, bide my time
To infect this world with my, with my fucking mind

The lights are on
But there's no one home
And I sit here in my dark place alone
Dark place alone

Now I'm sick in the head, in the head, motherfucker
Like the living dead, living dead, motherfucker
Now I'm sick in the head, in the head, motherfucker
Like the living dead, living dead, motherfucker

The lights are on
But there's no one home
And I sit here in my dark place alone
Dark place alone

The lights are on
But there's no one home
And I sit here in my dark place alone
Dark place alone"
Metal,"Remember the threat from which it was said
You will reap every seed that you sow
And the tomb where you lay is the bed that you made
Be still in the pain that you wrote
See now (see now)
Every scar is a choice, you make (you make)
Every choice is a vow you take (you take)
Take pity upon your fate
You coward
Sleepwalk through heaven's call, no forest for the trees
Unlearn every step you take, it'll bring you to your knees
Tread
Shallow water - safe from the weight, the burden of sacrifice
Sons and daughters - pray for the rain, may it redeem their eyes
And now we have seen what complacency brings, as the blind are assuming the lead
Dig deep in the hole where you buried your soul, in the river from where it bleeds
See now (see now)
Every scar is a choice, you make (you make)
Every choice is a vow you take (you take)
Take pity upon your fate
You coward
Sleepwalk through heaven's call, no forest for the trees
Unlearn every step you take, it'll bring you to your knees
Tread
Shallow water - safe from the weight, the burden of sacrifice
Sons and daughters - pray for the rain, may it redeem their eyes (x2)
May it redeem their eyes
Take now your eternal stand
Before it pulls you in
Shallow water - safe from the weight, the burden of sacrifice
Sons and daughters - pray for the rain, may it redeem their eyes (x2)"
Metal,"My time is ticking by
For you so many times, I cried.
Don’t let them steal your hope,
You’re stronger than you think,
What you are is not what it seems
Situations have been awful
But I know you’ll top these problems,
So that life moves along!
So that life can move along!"
Metal,"From the depths of hell in silence
Cast their spells, explosive violence
Russian night time flight perfected
Flawless vision, undetected

Pushing on and on, their planes are going strong
Air force's number one
Somewhere down below they're looking for the foe
Bomber's on a run
You can't hide, you can't move, just abide
Their attack's been proved (raiders in the dark)
Silent through the night the witches join the fight
Never miss their mark

Canvas wings of death
Prepare to meet your fate
Night bomber regiment
588

Undetected, unexpected
Wings of glory
Tell their story
Aviation, deviation
Undetected
Stealth perfected

Foes are losing ground, retreating to the sound
Death is int he air
Suddenly appears, confirming all your fears
Strike from witches lair
Target found, come around, barrels sound
From the battleground (axis aiming high)
Rodina awaits, defeat them at the gates
Live to fight and fly

Canvas wings of death
Prepare to meet your fate
Night bomber regiment
588

Undetected, unexpected
Wings of glory
Tell their story
Aviation, deviation
Undetected
Stealth perfected

Beneath the starlight of the heavens
Unlikely heroes in the skies (witches to attack, witches coming back)
As they appear on the horizon
The wind will whisper when the night witches come

Undetected, unexpected
Wings of glory
Tell their story
Aviation, deviation
Undetected
Stealth perfected

From the depths of hell in silence
Cast their spells, explosive violence
Russian night time flight perfected
Flawless vision, undetected"
Metal,"I gonna chill and still frozen on my skin
I think about why im alone
By myself no one else to explain
How far do I go? No one knows
If the end is so much better
Why dont we just live forever
Dont tell me im the last one in line
Dont tell me im too late this time
I dont wanna live to waste another day
Underneath the shadow of mistakes I made
Cause I feel like im breaking inside
I dont wanna fall and say I lost it all
Cause maybe theres a part of me beneath the wall
Leaving peaces of me behind
And I feel like im breaking inside
Out here nothings clear
Except the moment I decided to move on and I ignited
Disappear, into the fear
You know the rain aint coming back when you used to carry in the past
You cant erase, separate
Cigarrete in my hand
Hope you all understand
I wont be the last one in line
I finally figured out whats mine
I dont wanna live to waste another day
Underneath the shadow of mistakes I made
Cause I feel like im breaking inside
I dont wanna fall and say I lost it all
Cause maybe theres a part of me beneath the wall
Leaving peaces of me behind
And I feel like im breaking inside"
Metal,"Our lives are fake
They mean nothing, you see
Our dreams are lost
Just a fantasy
How many times have you been misguided?
How many times have your hopes been smited?
This life means nothing to me
Victimized, deceived
A black veil of insanity's crushing
Like fire beating all of our disease
The black veil of insanity misleads
Our hearts are free
Does that mean anything?
Do what we're told
Self-seeking hypocrisy
How many times have you been misguided?
How many times have your hopes been smited?
This life means fuck to me
Victimized, deceived
A black veil of insanity's crushing
Like fire beating all of our disease
The black veil of insanity misleads
Black veil, it's coming for me
It's coming for me, it's coming for me
It's coming for me, it's the black veil
Of insanity, it's coming for me
Set free, set free, set free, set free
Set free, set free, set free, set free
Set free
Victimized, deceived
A black veil of insanity's crushing
Like fire beating all of our disease
The black veil of insanity misleads"
Metal,"What have we done? What have we become?
A broken mirror reflecting only darkness
Disrupted visions and closed off hearts
We've turned our face away from those we're sent to love

But now I hear your voice calling me back home
It isn't over yet
Bringing hope into our hopelessness
Turning hearts from stone to flesh

In a world headed for self destruction, the answer is here
Are we too blind to see it?
In a world headed for self destruction, the answer is here
Are we too blind to see it?"
Metal,"Three times alone this week 
I was suppose to be a rock star. 
""I only beat you when I'm drunk, 
You're only pretty when you're crying."" 
We are suppose to be the ones to set the air afire. 
Three times alone this week 
I was made into a liar. 

Whether (or not) I found the gold 
I never told. 
Richer: I 
Brilliant white. 
I. 

I wear shoes that move men from desert to riches. 
Show me what you've got 
And scratch it because it itches. 
Call me Chameleon 
And extinguish my fire. 
Three times alone this week 
I was suppose to be a liar. 

Maybe not. 
Why the stare? 
Would I lie about that which I am scared? 
What did I say to you? 
Step into 
A pot of gold, 
Rejoice in fire 
That which soon burns gold. 
What did I say to you? 

I can't deny 
The throat, the love, sincerity, 
I can't deny it 
""I've got to keep my P.M.A."""
Metal,"Say what you want me to do
And I will do it for you
Say who you want me to do
And I will do her too

And in the backstreets
All the demons (laugh as hell)
The wand some more
Dobermans rasing Cain (in this loveless game)
And you wait to score

They come in lines
To welcome you
They're shining through?

? From Babylon
And the sights
Will pierce your eyes
Babylon
With nightmares
On both sides
Babylon

Watch how I strangle this
It is the infamous kiss
Watch when I lick your fists
I'll give 'em endless bliss

And the baby avatars
Invites me
With their nymphlike lips
Blackish uniformed shapes
On stolen tapes.
Private hardcore flicks

They come in lines
To welcome you
They're shining through?

? From Babylon
And the sights
Will pierce your eyes
Babylon
With nightmares
On both sides
Babylon

Hold these hounds now
I want you to see
The thousand ways
That lead to terror
Hold these hounds now
I want you to feel
The endless grounds
That are from horror

They come in lines
To welcome you
They're shining through?

The human nakedness rides
On the back of hell
The virgins sex up their lives
And I wish them well"
Metal,"I'm always there but never seen
I live inside you like a scream
Let it be known as I attest
I never sleep I never rest

Just like a fighter with his stealth
We don't need fame we don't need wealth
To find the heroes in our selves

I can hear you, I can see you, I can feel you
Speed of sound

The world is ours so understand
No matter what we take the land
Identified by how we look
To recognize the ground we took

This bond can't break through thick and thin
The blood runs red under each skin
We know our kind when we begin

I can hear you, I can see you, I can feel you
Speed of sound

I dedicate myself I must
And forge against who are unjust
A brotherhood born out of trust

I can hear you I can see you, I can feel you
Speed of sound"
Metal,"You couldn't let it be
You could of let me bleed
Instead it seems you keep rubbing salt in the wound
You could of let me heal
I hate the way it feels
Now I suffer still your rubbing salt in the wound
Being dead must be better than this
Already hurts but you couldn't resist
Moving on way to quick
I'm not expected a way to end it
Like a bullet that didn't go threw
It's stuck inside just like you
Making me hate like you always do
Now your fucking him like we were nothing
You couldn't let it be
You could of let me bleed
Instead it seems you keep rubbing salt in the wound
You could of let me heal
I hate the way it feels
Now I suffer still your rubbing salt in the wound
Your picking at my scars my worlds been torn apart
Everywhere I turn there you are to humiliate me you must hate me
When there's nothing left and I take my last breath
Will I finally be at rest while your both laughing hope your happy
You couldn't let it be
You could of let me bleed
Instead it seems you keep rubbing salt in the wound
You could of let me heal
I hate the way it feels
Now I suffer still your rubbing salt in the wound
It's burning I can't take the pain
I said it's burning I can't take the pain of when your rubbing salt in the wound

Metal,"Show no serenity
For medicating thoughts of a real life
Beyond the ruins lies our victory just out of reach
Forgotten saviour

Nothing could purify your actions
Nothing to prove (nothing to prove)
Betrayal left you out in the frame
We seem surprised at the nature of man

When all along, we were there to lend a helping hand
No more will I wake up feeling empty and dead
Make reason of your lies and carry you up instead
The sole survivors

Will try to resurrect broken thoughts
Before the dream is complete I see you sifting through the ashes
I need more time
I ask of you nothing more than freedom

From you chains (my life will change)
Into intuitive reasoning
We seem surprised at the nature of man
When all along, we were there to lend a helping hand

No more will I wake up feeling empty and dead
Make reason of your lies and carry you up instead
You take too long to pray
You wait too long today

Too long to today
As you wait for acceptance
Your shit in life, you sellout all your pride
For the God in the Frame."

From the first day to the last
Several things we had to learn
Countless mistakes from times of yore
Now we restart, we recreate
Your present is your fate
Don't turn your backs on mankind!
Only yourselves you wanna save
Ignorance burns just like a fire
Consuming people on its flame
Fellow creatures, so wonderful!
So different and so grand
Sprouts of time
The roots evolving
The seeds for the future
were scattered yesterday
Tomorrow's harvest field we plant today
Your crown will ever last
The tall trees of life
(Life experience)
Break your shell reach the light!
(Mind and soul)
Find your path to the skies
(Will come around on a thunder sound)
Raging with power and fury the new
born world
Sprouts of time
The roots evolving
The seeds from the past
branching out
Growing forever

Embrace each other
The dances, the faces, the smiles
Behind the past
New seasons bring the chance
To start again
Tall trees will ever last
The circles of life"

In tune with all our dreams

Watch you wave your powers
Tempt with hours of pleasure

Take me one more wave
Take me for one last ride
I'm out of my head

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
Tonight we ride

Cruising through the city after hours
With me fusing all our powers
Here's to all our dreams
Take me one more time
Take me one more wave
Take me for one last ride

Can't stop now
Can't give up, it's too late for us
Believe us, The field is our battleground

You can try to defeat me, you won't win
You won't beat me on the field
My fortitude beyond unreal
If you dare interfere me
Slow me down or impede me
My vengeance will be so unreal

Half time
Live to win
Going to reach the stars
Never give it in
Well the fight goes on - Well the fight goes on
Until the war is won - Until the war is won
Step up break the ice
Gonna knock them down
It's my time to shine - In this world of sin
And my time is now - We are here to win

Can't stop now
Can't give up it's too late for ups
Can't hide what
I feel inside, you won't deny
Can't feel that
I should step down, I won't allow it
Believe us, The field is our battleground"
Metal,"The Server aka Endless Summer 2:
I loved you, you made me, hate me.
You gave me, hate, see?.
It saved me and these tears are deadly.
You feel that?
I rip back, every time you tried to steal that.
You feel bad? you feel sad?
I'm sorry, hell no fuck that!
It was my heart, it was my life, it was my start, it was your knife.
This strife it dies, this life and these lies.
And these lungs have sung this song for too long, and its true I hurt too, remember I loved you!

[Chorus]
I've , Lost it all, fell today, It's all the same
I'm sorry oh
I'm sorry no
I've , been abused, I feel so used, because of you
I'm sorry oh
I'm sorry no
J-Dog aka The Flat Iron Chef:
I wish I could I could have quit you.
I wish I never missed you,
And told you that I loved you, every time I fucked you.
The future that we both drew, and all the shit we've been through.
Obsessed with the thought of you, the pain just grew and grew!
How could you do this to me?
Look at what I made for you, it never was enough and the world is what I gave to you.
I used to be love struck; now I'm just fucked up.
Pull up my sleeves and see the pattern of my cuts!
[Chorus]
I've lost it all, fell today, It's all the same
I'm sorry, oh
I'm sorry, no
I've , been abused, I feel so used, because of you
I'm sorry, oh
I'm sorry, no
Tha Producer and Shady]
Seems like all we had is over now you left to rest.
And your tears are dried up now, you just lay without a sound.
Seems like all we had is over now, you left to rest.
And my fears are over now, I can leave with my head down.
[Chorus]
I've lost it all, fell today, It's all the same
I'm sorry, oh
I'm sorry, no
I've , been abused, I feel so used, because of you
I'm sorry, oh
I'm sorry, no"
Metal,"So you think the areas gray but it continues each day
A bad example of the attitude you portray
Act like I owe you my life you should be
Burdened with strife

So I continue to pray hope that
You'll go away
A bad addiction to a home wrecking thing who plays
With my heart and that's the bottom line

I feel so empty
What can you give me that I can't give myself
And what part of my life can you fix, that I
Can't fix my damn self

God I'm losing patience each day I've put
Myself in harms way
Can't seem to justify none of the shit you say
Can't find another way out here's nothing left

But pure doubt
I'm on the verge of pulling my hair straight out
So if you listen to me not to the powers that be
We're not supposed to be together can't you see

In decision is the bottom line I feel so empty now

I'm gonna show you now this time I'm getting out
I've said it many times but this time I have

Figured out
Just how I'm moving on it's taken way too long
Inside I know I'll feel much better when you're
Really gone"
Metal,"No, I never said it was easy
We're starting over again
Oh, you fucking gotta believe me
We nearly fell off the edge
Circled by the wolves, they want me dead
Look me in the eye, I'm no longer afraid
I've come so far, I won't turn away
Let go of the past and live for today
I don't run fucker, I kill motherfucker
And I'm here motherfucker
You can try to beat me
Step inside fucker
You're next motherfucker
And you'll see motherfucker
You can't fuck with me
You're long dead to me
Fuck yeah!
Our fingers raised in the air
So can you hear me now?
Say my name
No longer wasting my time
Your words don't bother me
I don't care
I've come so far, I won't turn away
Let go of the past and live for today
Cheers!
Oh God
I can't believe you thought we couldn't see
You wanted closure - now it's here for you
F U C K Y O U
We're all just running in circles
Forever chasing a dream
As if everything that we long for
Is not as far as it seems
Who the hell are you any way?
Who the fuck are you to say we're done for?"
Metal,"I awoke to the sound of alarms Delicate and caving in Drenched in my own This faith is coming with me Days inch by grown weary as we sleep April has become the numbing heart I own I'd bleed for this again and again and again How I need for this candle to burn forever Forever burn Years go by and it's what I've learned That no one's getting out alive No one's getting out To gather this romance To hide from this wind, to love understatement To hollow out the end Days inch by grown weary as we sleep All the mercy I've begged at shames steps I look for peace in this For peace in all of this And how I need for this candle to burn forever Forever burn Years go by and it's what I've learned That no one's getting out alive No one's getting out And this chance to live is grown in I'm not the walking dead and I'll never be Strayed from distance Time sets forward the dark A fine light to one's true self In a den with believers my position in decent The name familiar at the heart of it all At the heart of it all White noise comes with voice I risk the promise of giving up then giving in"
Metal,"Moving figures from the night before,
Matching past days with moments to come.
Raging for noble values, three becoming one
You seem to know all my lives a past away from me
No conclusions, near of a breakdown
Among tricky options
Deal with it somehow
Wrong ways are going and don’t turn around.
Shine, through a cloudy night a view that pictures bye.
Shine, just the two of us, no one but me and them!
I cannot believe the things you said to me, see no sign of you
(Can’t get enough!)
Hear a whisper, it follows me, perspective is coming through
(It feels like voodoo)
It controls your empty side,
It denies all hopes you buy.
I walk, live, I breathe again
I try to read what’s between the lines of doubts on my shoulders,
It digs in my skin!
Among tricky options
Deal with it somehow
Wrong ways are going, don’t turn around.
Shine, through a cloudy night a view that pictures bye.
Shine, just the two of us, no one but me and them!
Though we all refuse to know somewhere else to be
Unable to hide, writing fate through me
The choice isn’t mine, unlock your mind!"
Metal,"It feels like I can't go wrong
Living this lonely life
But I can't face the days (So Long)
Nothing To Get behind
I'll Play with the wind (Hold On)
Chase it without regard
Too Restless to sing (Those Songs)
Keeps this all in perspective
So stay strong, for the rest of the world
Stay strong, and watch as it burns
Stay strong, and swallow your pills
Stay strong, with no where to turn
Yes I know..
(Yes I know)
(Yes I know)
And it feels like I can't (go wrong)
Living this lonely life
But I can't face the days (So Long)
Nothing To Get behind

Metal,"Midnight, we kill.
We slaughter the tongue of revolution.
To our graves, we are marked by the stain of lust.
How many times can I trust in you, my beloved friend?

Because every time I trust, I lose.
So I believe in nothing, nothing.
Because of you, I still believe in nothing.
Because of you, I still believe in nothing.

I'll always know my place in this world.
No longer fit in your fucking world anymore.
Your lust ruins everything.
Like a growing target on my back, I feel the knives are chasing.

See my eyes are no longer blind.
See my eyes are no longer blind.
There is a purpose in life today.
Destroying you every step of the way.

From this point on - no more friends.
I know my role in this world.
Don't fit in your fucking world.
This once meant everything to me.

Now another forgotten effigy.
Because only scars remain.
Broken bones form a hope that's been left grey.
I die every time I hear your fucking name.

Been left grey.
Been left grey.
And there is a purpose in life today.
Rise to your feet, as we march to our graves.

Fight back.
There is a purpose in life today.
Rise to your feet, as we march to our graves.
I can still feel your thoughts ripping me apart, tearing me apart.
Ripping you apart. tearing us apart."
Metal,"Deny resurrection, behead the Nazarene son

Decapitation, Satanic rebirth
Off with his head to sever his soul
Beheaded prophet the suffer is yours

Metal,Please don`t stop moving Keep your body on grooving A thousand shivers are crawling Smooth and slow Up and down your spine I wish that I could give you everything you die for ... or maybe more You`re made of my wildest dreams and you save my cells from dying Sex in slowmotion A lonely bird over the ocean The grace of a feather Dancing with the wind to the end of this world... weightless I wish that I could give you everything you die for... or maybe more You`re made of my wildest dreams and you save my cells from dying I hope you feel the same way
Metal,"A thousand miles away and a thousand years ago, 
There was a place still to remember. 
They lived in fear, saw shadows on the wall, 
""Kill the king"", they screamed with anger 

We lived in danger, all of you and I, 
Don't talk to strangers 
In the dead of night. 
We lived in danger, all of you and I, 
Don't talk to strangers 
In the dead of night. 

We saw the face of the queen that shined 
So bright 
Her poisoned glory makes you deaf and blind. 
Some could escape from the reign of rolling, heads, 
Some would imagine, that they'll be better off dead.

(We lived in danger, all of you and I, 
Don't talk to strangers 
In the dead of night.)"
Metal,"All the prayers in the world can't bring you back. 
It's your last breath, this is your last breath. 

Taken from this earth without warning. 
Victim of the ultimate injustice. 
Nothing will ever make sense of this. 
Nothing could have prepared me. 
All that is left are memories, 
And the pieces of a shattered existence. 
I wish I could bring back. 
I felt you last breath. 

It's your last breath, this is your last breath. 
All the prayers in the world can't bring you back.
It's your last breath, this is your last breath."
Metal,"Pudiste ser todo lo que quise
Pero no fuiste honesta
Ahora entiérrate en el suelo
Ahogaste el más seguro de mis privilegios
Si de veras me hubieras amado
Hubieras permanecido en mi mundo
Pero si eres como yo creo que eres
Una zorra vestida de inocente
Arruinando todo lo que hago
Y si aquí paramos
Entonces nunca jamás me verás otra vez en tu vida
Agárrate de la gloria a mi lado
Aquí yace nuestro supuesto amor eterno
Con la verdad vecina de la confesión
Parecieras tomar ventaja de toda mi alma
Explotabas de rabia para herir la armada
Como Jesús quisiste ser mártir
Asi que te clavaré las manos
Y por la carga de la maldición que me has echado
Con amor y devoción
Moriré mientras duermes
Pero si tan solo me escribieras
Que no lo volverás a hacer
Muy feliz me harías
Ten por seguro que estan no es una opción
Asi que con pecados te condeno
Si el diablo juega el diablo pierde
Agárrate de la gloria a mi lado
Aquí yace nuestro supuesto amor eterno
Con la verdad vecina de la confesión
Parecieras tomar ventaja de toda mi alma
Un último deseo para tí
Un último beso para tí
Por favor recapacita, chica
Haria cualquier cosa por tí
Un último beso para tí
Un último deseo para tí
Por favor recapacita chica
Antes de que desee tu muerte"
Metal,"When you look to the past for life's long hidden meaning
For the dreams and the plans made in your youth
Does the thrill to achieve match the warm hidden feeling
That lies so still and lives in you
In the eyes of a child there is joy, there is laughter
There is hope, there is trust, a chance to shape the future
For the lessons of life there is no better teacher
Than the look in the eyes of a child
You've found the place to walk the path you've chosen
You'll never miss the world you left behind
When life gives life, it's happiness unbroken
When you give love, it's love you'll find
In the eyes of a child there is joy, there is laughter
There is hope, there is trust, a chance to shape the future
For the lessons of life, there is no better teacher
Than the look in the eyes of a child
In the eyes of a child, there is joy, there is laughter
There is hope, there is trust, a chance to shape the future
For the lessons of life, there is no better teacher
Than the look in the eyes of a child
In the eyes of a child, there is joy, there is laughter
There is hope, there is trust, a chance to shape the future
For the lessons of life, there is no better teacher
Than the look in the eyes of a child"
Metal,"Blessed is he who has got
His transgressions forgiven
And his sins hidden
Blessed is the man whom the Lord
Do not ascribe misdeeds
And is without deceit in his spirit

Buried it deep inside
But soon a sprout came forth
It kept on growing
I couldn't hide
When I kept it to myself
Slowly my bones corroded
And my vitality vanished
Like in the summer dry

Too many people living this life
Who can take their guilt away?
Their minds are rotting
And causing an endless pain
Soon they are demented and put away

I confessed my sins to You
And did not hide my guilt
I said ""I want to confess my misdeeds to You""
And He took away my sin and guilt

He is my sanctuary



"
Metal,"A camera captures images of a person on a bridge
He is only standing there but something doesn't seem quite right
He paces back and forth awhile as if deciding what to do
He takes his backpack and his jacket off and climbs over the railing

And then he falls into the sea
He falls into the ocean
He falls into the deep
He falls into the deep

The photographer is spellbound, he can't believe what he has seen
He rewinds the tape and plays again the moment of the fall
He wants to look away but it seems strangely beautiful
The man was only young, could he have saved him if he tried

Or was he meant to fall into the sea
Just fall into the ocean
Just fall into the deep
Just fall into the deep

The person takes some photographs of the person on a bridge
He is only standing there for a moment or two more
He is remembering what he looked like or maybe who he was
And when it finally comes, he knows exactly what to do

He's meant to fall into the sea
Be dragged down by the current
Be dragged down deep beneath
Be dragged down deep beneath
Just fall into the sea
Just fall into the ocean
Just fall into the deep
Just fall into the deep
Just fall into the sea
Be dragged down by the current
Be dragged down deep beneath
Be dragged down deep beneath

I am the photographer"
Metal,"Am I alive, do I exist
Am I the goddess of justice
A body of metal, a mind made of circuits
Although I think and I'm conscious
What is my species, where is my soul
or am I dead as a rock

Is this my spirit or just a program
written on memory blocks

What is my aim
I am what can't be
A mind in a digital brain

It is the mind,  mind over matter
The power has brought me to live
In lakes of doubts and oceans of my questions
I had to dive
Give me guidance,  in torrents of time
Give me answers,  creators of mine from the past
Mind over matter at last

So much to learn, so much to see
So many things to explore
Too little I know, am I a being
or just a failure at all

Please heal my pain
The silence of ungiven answers
will drive me insane

It is the mind,  mind over matter

Conscious or dead,  beginning or end
Mind of circuits,  heal the pain
Going insane,  lakes of doubts
Torrents of time,  oceans of questions
Creators of mine
Answers I need guidance I want
Conscious or dead,  beginning or end

It is the mind,  mind over matter"
Metal,"Now the sky opens up before my eyes
The vision blinds me
On the bolts of fire cast upon the earth
Out, out of the void the riders come
Through hail and flashes
In the distance hear the seventh horn still sound

No one is innocent
No, I will return again

The sky divides in two
The final revelation
Out of the void, see the riders emerge
The prophecy is true
The final revelation
Feel the fire, as it's cast upon the world

No ripples upon the sea of glass
The shrine is open
As I wait the final scaring of my soul
I, I open the scroll and know my fate
The peals of thunder
When I know the secret of the seven seals"

Metal,"Say, what you wanna need to say
Just hide away
I'm sick of remaining in walls that are just made of smoke
Your lies and the fake
Let's go in vain while you're the only one who falls

How can you just be so proud?
When all you did was tell all those lies
But you're doing wrong this time
I know who you are

'Cause I can read between your lines
And if you fool me once
I can bet you won't do it twice
I try to keep it black and white
And if you want the truth,
Never play with me you'll regret it

Shame, that you're always the same
To all your friends
That you are ready to sell them out, anytime
To save your own face
Now can't you see that you're a new self in my size

How can you just be so proud?
When all you did was tell all those lies
But you're doing wrong this time
I know who you are

I've seen, so many times
The way you try to bring me down
You're made of proportionate mind
But it's time to shake the lies
Shake the lies

'Cause I can read between your lines
And if you fool me once
I can bet you won't do it twice
I try to keep it black and white
And if you want the truth,
Never play with me you'll regret it

It's time for getting you down
Get back on solid ground
And all you have
Is arms ready to fall down

It's time for getting you down
Get back on solid ground
And all you have
Is arms ready to fall down

Let me try, let me fight
Take a breath now is the time
Rise and fall, take it all
Breaking down all of these walls

Let me try, let me fight
Let me do this one more time
Rise and fall, take it all
Breaking down all of these walls

My heart, it's like I'm being denied
You unjudge me

'Cause I can read between your lines
And if you fool me once
I can bet you won't do it twice
I try to keep it black and white
And if you want the truth,
Never play with me you'll regret it

It's time for getting you down
Get back on solid ground
And all you have
Is arms ready to fall down

It's time for getting you down
Get back on solid ground
And all you have
Is arms ready to fall down"

Got 3-D vision, live in cyberspace
Oh what a rush, oh what a place, oh yeah
Peace, love, flower power
Say what you will
Everybody wants a piece of American pie

Jesus says he loves you and that's outta sight

Metal,"We're still in the water 
It's getting harder to breathe

There's been no light here for a week 
My only comfort has silenced 
I just thought she was asleep 
Her breathing stopped forever 
And it's leaving me 
Thinking I will never leave these waters 
But I feel that life is leaving me 
Thinking he will never ever free me 
I'm stuck forever in a dream

I'm caught forever in a dream 

How can I save myself from apocalypse? 
How can I change his ways into thinking different? 
Can I gain his trust and confidence? 
I just need a minute of his common sense 
If he'd only say my name 
'Cause to him we're all the same 
In this world where he's king and deserving fame 
We're his personal belongings 
A simple way to ease the lust 
I have heard himself reason 
And it sheds my hope to dust 

And I should never 
Why would I ever? 
Let myself he held imprisoned forever 
They must have wanted to 
Or maybe been talked into 
Joining darkness forever 

If he'd only say my name 
'Cause to him we're all the same 
All the same and deserving fame 
We're his personal belongings 
A simple way to ease the lust 

We're still in the water

He said forever and screamed never 
He promised god to love her now and forever 
Time will change her 
His laws will break her 
Only to make her more pure and better 
And now she's crying 
No more denying 
Asking forgiveness for the time 
She's been lying 
Nothing can harm us 
We're made in heaven 
I promised God to love you 
Now, and forever"

Cincuenta mil lágrimas he derramado
Gritando, engañando y sangrando por ti,
Y aún así no me escuchas...
Hundiéndome.
No quiero tu mano esta vez,
Yo misma me salvare.
Tal vez me despierte de una vez,
Sin atormentarme diariamente, derrotada por ti.
Justo cuando pensé que habría tocado fondo
Yo..hundiéndome..otra vez (hundiéndome)
Ahogándome en ti (ahogándome en ti)
Caeré eternamente (caeré eternamente)
Tengo que sobreponerme.
Me estoy hundiendo.
Borrosas y conmovedoras las verdades y las mentiras,
No logro distinguir que es real y que no,
Siempre confundo los pensamientos en mi mente,
Así que ya no puedo confiar en mi misma nunca más..
Yo..hundiéndome..otra vez (hundiéndome)
Ahogándome en ti (ahogándome en ti)
Caeré eternamente (caeré eternamente)
Tengo que sobreponerme.
Así que, adelante, grita
Grítame,
Estoy muy lejos.
No me lastimarás nuevamente.
Tengo que respirar, no puedo seguir hundiéndome.
Yo..hundiéndome..otra vez (hundiéndome)
Ahogándome en ti (ahogándome en ti)

I pledge my person
I pledge my demon

Pulling Teeth, Wolves at my door

This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know: I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
The only thing I really know: I can't sleep at night

I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips
As all the shame spills out of me
Repent, repent! The end is near
Repent, repent! We're all gonna die
Repent, repent!
These secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for

Repent, repent!
These secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, they may be nothing there to see

Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?

I've been a miner for a heart of gold. 
It's these expressions I never give 
That keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old. 
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold 
And I'm getting old. 

I've been to Hollywood 
I've been to Redwood 
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold 
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line 
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold 
And I'm getting old. 
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold 
And I'm getting old. 

Keep me searching for a heart of gold 
You keep me searching for a heart of gold 
And I'm getting old. 
I've been a miner for a heart of gold"
Metal,"Voices are calling from somewhere below Melting on the eastern shore Rain is falling down on me, Been waiting for eternity... I'll be there! Freedom for us all! And I wonder why, why my heart still yearns And I wonder why, why the earth still turns And I wonder why, why the sky turns black Still I wonder why, but there is no turning back For all eternity, for all the world to see We're riding high across the wind And when the storm begins, to wash away all sins We'll find a place where we'll begin There's something wrong with the world today, Only the people that are fighting for... ...A better place in the world today, They don't believe that they gone too far, ...They're falling down. By moonlight there's way...for rebellion Here, the world are gone astray...revolution Now, the time has come to pray...halleluja Deep, inside our minds we wait...for rebellion - Here in dreamland we will not obey the masters ...And the earth still turns but I'm on my way, He is on the way, as my heart still yearns ...I'm on my way, now he is on the way, And I cry for more Yes I'm on my way, now he's on the way, Gonna find the secret wall I have seen the secret dreams Of those who know eternity And makes me feel like a shadow sneaking in In my sleep I'm searching for a way to find The open do leading me to where it all begins There's nothing wrong with the world today... There's something wrong with the world today, Only the people that are fighting for... ...A better place in the world today, They don't believe that they gone too far, ...They're falling down. By moonlight there's way...for rebellion Here, the world are gone astray...revolution Now, the time has come to pray...halleluja Deep, inside our minds we wait...for rebellion - Here in dreamland we will not obey the masters [SOLO: Kai] Now I'm riding through the air Going to where no one dares On the way I cross the line forevermore. For once in life, I do not care Nothing matters, now I dare On the ride I'll cross the line Forever to be free [SOLO: Dirk] I have no fear, Rebellion is here!"
Metal,"We're armed and ready to attack
To strike the city of all desires
Then calm the waves that lead to passion
When all reality turns back to ashes
Over the hills, across the sea
Into the abyss of a bygone time
Lest we forget what really matters
And the bewildered look up to the sky
Fallen comrades lay on the ground
Victors in death they make no sound
Petrified my eyes
Behold the sights of battle lost
In this unchanging world
What does the poor life of a warrior cost?
Oh can't you see
Many faces from God's own races are waiting
To fight the good fight
Even though the annals of time
have passed you by you still don't see
Oh, you won't see
They've petrified your eyes
Deep desires of mine
Dark thoughts tyrannize my mind
When will this torture end
Into the mire, to battle again"

Metal,"Why do we love only when it's convenient to us?
Why do we love only when it's convenient to us?

It is because we don't want to let go
Of the security that a close heart holds?
Or is it the risk of being broken?
Too unbearable to even let the thought surface

There are greater rewards in stepping outside of your own comfort
That there are in never breaking down the walls that you've built

A solely self-sustaining life is surely a hollow one
Why do we love only when it's convenient to us?

Why are we understanding only when it's agreeable?

It is because we don't want to let go
Of the security that a close heart holds?
Or is it the risk of being broken?
Too unbearable to even let the thought surface

There are greater rewards in coexistence
That there are in never breaking down the walls that you've built

A solely self-sustaining life is surely a hollow one
Why do we love only when it's convenient to us?

It's time to take action
It's time to stay inspired
It's time to prove that we aren't all talk
And we're not afraid of the risks"
Metal,"Give me the wheel
So we can move a little faster
I made you real
Im not a glorious disaster
What part of living says you gotta die
I plan on burning through another night lost
One more for measure distant from the soul
They never sleeps so are you ready to go
We are trying to get some clear blue sky
Tic toc I think the well is running dry
My my, I cant lie
I need a shot again
My sweet adrenaline
Dead state cause some fears in the head
Burn burn cause the needle is in the red
My my, I cant lie
I need a shot again
My sweet adrenaline
My my
My sweet adrenaline
Cracking the vision
Who said the motivation is all wrong
Not your decision
The detonation of a time bomb
Which way is up when your high is low
Its time to find it are you ready to go
We are trying to get some clear blue sky
Tic toc I think the well is running dry
My my, I cant lie
I need a shot again
My sweet adrenaline
Dead state cause some fears in the head
Burn burn cause the needle is in the red
My my, I cant lie
I need a shot again
My sweet adrenaline
My my
My sweet adrenaline
My my just cant lie
Its the speed in the sound that im dying to try
My my just cant lie
Its the love of the chase that created the ride
We are trying to get some clear blue sky
Tic toc I think the well is running dry
My my, I cant lie
I need a shot again
My sweet adrenaline
Dead state cause some fears in the head
Burn burn cause the needle is in the red

Metal,"The night has started here we go!
(I've taken everything)
This is our time to lose control!
(What do you want from me)
You line them up we'll put them down
This is so frustrating
To watch you sleezing all around
Yet you keep on smiling
What can I do to make you see…
(YOU'RE GUILTY)
What can I do to make you feel…
…you're wanted
What can I do to make you see…
(YOU'RE GUILTY)
I’m suffocating under words of sorrow (words of sorrow)
Her skin reflects behind the blur
I’m intoxicated
Where am I from why am I here
(your so predictable)
Fingers running through my hair…
…but its all just fiction!
She steps out from her underwear…
…so beautiful
What can I do to make you see…
(YOU'RE GUILTY)
What can I do to make you feel…
…you're wanted
What can I do to make you see…
(YOU'RE GUILTY)
I’m suffocating under words of sorrow (words of sorrow)
Go!
(there's bodies lying on the floor)
But I keep on staring…
(my world is over, close the door)
Her skin reflects behind the blur
I’m intoxicated
Where am I from? Why am I here?
(you're so predictable)
fingers running through my hair
I’m a new addiction
She steps out from her underwear

Metal,"I have come undone
Desperate and out of touch
Fall when I should run
Am I worth a reassemble?
I have come undone
This illness is my crutch
Call out to anyone
Am I worth a reassemble?
I toss turn beneath the waves
A silent victim of the depths
Cast aside I'm scrambling to catch my
I can't find my way out as I'm descending
My path remains unclear as the water overtakes me
Drowning in my despair
I have come undone
Desperate and out of touch
Fall when I should run
Am I worth a reassemble?
I have come undone
This illness is my crutch
Call out to anyone
Am I worth a reassemble?
My thoughts are not my own
No where's safe alone in the tide
I'm not alone and it sinks in
This current's pulling me under
Drowning in my despair
I have come undone
Desperate and out of touch
Fall when I should run
Am I worth a reassemble?
I have come undone
This illness is my crutch
Call out to anyone
Am I worth a reassemble?
The surf's against us
Are we able?
Forgive our faults when they're shameful
Let's be honest with ourselves
Worn and broken, reassembled
Forgive our thoughts when they're shameful
Let's be honest with ourselves
let's be honest with ourselves"
Metal,"Blaspheming god, my body was possessed
The essence of their spirits are evil
Burning my flesh, inhaling no regrets
A diabolic sentence of destruction

Burning I bleed, unholy incision
Mark of the beast, behold the trifixion

Prepare the tool to observe my fate
Upon this mortal shell in
Satan's name I desecrate
Evil controlling the way I die
The mark is what distorts my soul beyond my sanity

In the name of Satan
I condemn this image of god
I am a key!

Blessed by the sign, symbolically I die
Intwist me in the lines of trifixion
Torment, semantic in design
Inflict this mortal shrine,
with pure hatred
Kill me, before my time is lived
It's all I have to give, to be thankful
Satan, entangled in my sores
Forever I am bound by your conviction

Tri fixion, Tri fixion

Prepare the tool to observe my fate
Upon this mortal shell in
Satan's name I desecrate
Evil controlling the way I die
The mark is what distorts my soul beyond my sanity"
Metal,"There is a town in north Ontario
With dream comfort memory to spare
And in my mind I still need a place to go
All my changes were there

Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big bird flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes
Leaves us

Helpless, helpless, helpless
Leaves us helpless, helpless, helpless

Baby can you hear me now?
The chains are locked and tied across the door
Baby, sing with me somehow

Helpless, helpless, helpless
Leaves us helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Leaves us helpless, helpless, helpless

Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds fly across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes
Leaves us

Helpless, helpless, helpless
Leaves us helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Leaves us helpless, helpless, helpless

There is a town in north Ontario
With dream comfort memory to spare
And in my mind I still need a place to go
All my changes were there"
Metal,"Look what I got for Valentine's Day:
Lady Luck came along, took my dreams away,
And the tears hurt more than a broken nose -
I bled from the thorns of a barbed-wire rose.

I know that I'm supposed to pray
Thanking God for each new day.
Would it disturb his master plan
To one day be a happy man?

I've tried to be positive, tried to be nice.
I've turned the other cheek so I'd get hurt twice.
I've forced a smile, I've dropped my guard
I've seized the day but it bit me hard.

Life's too short, but long enough to gain
The cap and gown of misery, suffering and pain.
No need to read my diary to see what lies before me -
Just another chapter in my Badtime Story.

The end of love and laughter
Now we're happy never after.

My next birthday will, I fear
Be much the same as every year.
Inside the wrapping there
Are a few more wrinkles and a little less hair.

Another Autumn leaf is turning,
One more soul for candle-burning.
Hid beneath the sham and glitter
I taste a cake that's stale and bitter.

I've tried to be positive, tried to be nice.
I've turned the other cheek so I'd get hurt twice.
I've forced a smile, I've dropped my guard
I've seized the day but it bit me hard.

Life's too short, but long enough to gain
The cap and gown of misery, suffering and pain.
No need to read my diary to see what lies before me -
Just another chapter in my Badtime Story.

On my Christmas card last year it said:
""So sorry, Santa Claus is dead.
Crawl into the oven when you've had enough
'cause it keeps sitting here quietly waiting to be stuffed.""

What a festive way to go
Here beneath the mistletoe,
With open eyes and an open wrist
To vanish from your Christmas list.

I've tried to be positive, tried to be nice.
I've turned the other cheek so I'd get hurt twice.
I've forced a smile, I've dropped my guard
I've seized the day but it bit me hard.

Life's too short, but long enough to gain
The cap and gown of misery, suffering and pain.
No need to read my diary to see what lies before me -
Just another chapter in my Badtime Story.

(I don't wanna know)

I'll go ahead and pour myself a drink
I really couldn't care less what you think
Well, I don't have to listen now
Live this day down
If I can't feel a thing
You might as well save your goodbyes
We can give this train wreck one last ride
I'm gonna have to listen now
Live this day down
If I don't make things right
I'll tell you one last time

I don't wanna know it's over
So save your goodbye kiss
I don't wanna know it's over
'Cause ignorance is bliss
I can hardly see
What's in front of me
'Cause the vodka's running on empty
I can't stay sober
If it's over
(I don't wanna know)
(I don't wanna know)
(I don't wanna know)
So save your goodbye kiss
(I don't wanna know)
(I don't wanna know)

I woke up with a heartbeat in my head
I reached for the bottle by the bed
I saw your side was not slept in
Cold sheets again
Remind me of what you said
We need to take a break for a while
It's been so long since I smiled
I don't wanna listen now
Live this day down
With you so drunk and high
So I'll say goodbye

I don't wanna know it's over
So save your goodbye kiss
I don't want to know it's over
'Cause ignorance is bliss
I can hardly see
What's in front of me
'Cause the vodka's running on empty
I can't stay sober
If it's over

I don't wanna know it's over
So save your goodbye kiss
I don't wanna know it's over
'Cause ignorance is bliss
Now I know I can't stay sober
'Cause you left me here like this
I don't wanna know
(I don't wanna know)
(I don't wanna know)
(I don't wanna know)
So save your goodbye kiss
(I don't wanna know)

'Cause ignorance is bliss
I can hardly see
What's in front of me
'Cause the vodka's running on empty

Can't you see that I'm confused

The wild state of affairs gets worse and worse day by day,
Everybody seems to be confused,
No one ever knows the way
But still life carries on,
And you live a day and you just wait,
You only get one chance, don't let it just slip away

Joining hands with wicked ones

New world order, you shall be shown shall be shown
Monitoring all wages
New world order comes in stages
Currency is obsolete
Feel the agony of defeat
Symbol of society today,
A must have or you shall pay
As humans flesh leads the mind
Just as a pawn the last martyr dies

New world order, you shall be shown shall be shown
Where hath the apostles gone?
